# Known Issues

Here are some known bugs and issues with SurrealDB:

## SDKs

- Some query functionality is not yet available in the SDKs. Such as `IF EXISTS` and `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses in the [DEFINE statement](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/define/). This means that if you used these clauses in your query method(as seen in the example below), the SDK would not be able to parse the query correctly.

```js
await db.query(
    'DEFINE FIELD IF NOT EXISTS email ON TABLE user TYPE string;'
);
```

## SurrealQL

- In the [`DELETE` statement](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/delete) the `ONLY` clause doesn't work as expected because it checks for a length of 1 and DELETE doesn't return anything by default at this time. So it always gives an error. However, adding RETURN $before will force DELETE to return the deleted record, which will be the expected length of 1.

```surql
CREATE person:one;

// Currently fails
DELETE ONLY person:one;

// Workaround: add RETURN $before
DELETE ONLY person:one RETURN $before;
