# Statements

SurrealDB has a variety of statements that let you configure and query a database: `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and so on.

## Statement parameters

A number of parameters prefixed with `$` are automatically available within a statement that provide access to relevant context inside the statement. These are known as reserved variable names. For example:

* `$before` and `$after` can be accessed in statements that mutate values to see the values before and after an update,
* `$session` provides context on the current session,
* `$parent` provides access to the value in a primary query while inside a subquery.

For a full list of these automatically generated parameters, see the [parameters](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/parameters#reserved-variable-names) page.
