# `SHOW` statement

The `SHOW` statement can be used to replay changes made to a table.

## Requirements
- You must first [`DEFINE`](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/define/table#example-usage) a [Change Feed](https://surrealdb.com/cf).

### Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
SHOW CHANGES FOR TABLE @tableName SINCE "@timestamp" | "@versionstamp" [LIMIT @number]
```

## Example usage
### Basic usage

The following example shows usage of the SHOW statement.

```surql
-- Define the change feed and its duration
DEFINE TABLE reading CHANGEFEED 3d;

-- Create some records in the reading table
CREATE reading SET story = "Once upon a time";
CREATE reading SET story = "There was a database";
-- Define another table with a changefeed
DEFINE TABLE cat CHANGEFEED 3d;
CREATE cat SET story = "And there was a cat";
CREATE reading SET story = "Fine, there was a database and also a cat";

-- Replay changes to the reading table since a date
SHOW CHANGES FOR TABLE reading SINCE "2023-09-07T01:23:52Z" LIMIT 10;
-- Or replay changes to the reading table beginning at a version stamp
SHOW CHANGES FOR TABLE reading SINCE 1 LIMIT 10;
```

:::note
__Note:__ `SINCE <time>` needs to be after the time the `CHANGEFEED` was defined.
:::

Defining a `CHANGEFEED` on multiple tables still feeds their changes into a single database-wide changefeed. As a result, the `SHOW CHANGES FOR TABLE reading SINCE 1 LIMIT 10;` query above for the `reading` table does not show changes for `versionstamp` 4 and 5, which pertain to changes for the `cat` table.

```bash
[
	[
		{
			changes: [
				{
					define_table: {
						name: 'reading'
					}
				}
			],
			versionstamp: 1
		},
		{
			changes: [
				{
					update: {
						id: reading:9fvsk6nxzthdx4mjvxci,
						story: 'Once upon a time'
					}
				}
			],
			versionstamp: 2
		},
		{
			changes: [
				{
					update: {
						id: reading:nj739p8mrc2hurq68g9b,
						story: 'There was a database'
					}
				}
			],
			versionstamp: 3
		},
		{
			changes: [
				{
					update: {
						id: reading:34xgb6n99ico70wu8ebf,
						story: 'Fine, there was a database and also a cat'
					}
				}
			],
			versionstamp: 6
		}
	]
];
```
