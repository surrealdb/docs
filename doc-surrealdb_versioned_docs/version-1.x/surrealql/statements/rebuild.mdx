# `REBUILD` statement

The `REBUILD` statement is used to rebuild resources like indexes.

From time to time, it is useful to rebuild indexes. M-TREE and HNSW index performances can degrade due to frequent updates.
Rebuilding the index will ensure the index is fully optimized.

### Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
REBUILD [
	INDEX [ IF EXISTS ] @name ON [ TABLE ] @table
]
```

## Example usage
### Basic usage

The following queries show an example of how to rebuild resources

```surql
REBUILD INDEX authors ON TABLE article;
```

### Using if exists clause <l className='purple'>Since 1.3.0</l>

The following queries show an example of how to rebuild resources using the `IF EXISTS` clause, which will only rebuild the resource if it exists.

```surql
REBUILD INDEX IF EXISTS authors ON TABLE article;
```
