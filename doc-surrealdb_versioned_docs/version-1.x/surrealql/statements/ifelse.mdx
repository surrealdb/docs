# `IF ELSE` statement

The `IF ELSE` statement can be used as a main statement, or within a parent statement, to return a value depending on whether a condition, or a series of conditions match. The statement allows for multiple `ELSE IF` expressions, and a final `ELSE` expression, with no limit to the number of `ELSE IF` conditional expressions.

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
IF @condition [ THEN ]
	@expression
[ ELSE IF @condition [ THEN ]
	@expression ... ]
[ ELSE
	@expression ]
[ END ]
```

## Example usage
### Basic usage
The following query shows example usage of this statement.

```surql
IF $scope = "admin" THEN
	( SELECT * FROM account )
ELSE IF $scope = "user" THEN
	( SELECT * FROM $auth.account )
ELSE
	[]
END
```

### Advanced usage
You can also have nested conditions:

```surql
IF $scope = "admin" THEN
    ( SELECT * FROM admin_data WHERE access_level = 'full' )
ELSE IF $scope = "user" THEN
    IF $auth.role = "premium" THEN
        IF $auth.subscription_status = "active" THEN
            ( SELECT * FROM premium_user_data WHERE active = 1 )
        ELSE IF $auth.subscription_status = "trial" THEN
            ( SELECT * FROM trial_user_data )
        ELSE
            ( SELECT * FROM basic_user_data )
        END
    ELSE IF $auth.role = "standard" THEN
        ( SELECT * FROM standard_user_data WHERE region = 'US' )
    ELSE IF $auth.role = "standard" AND $auth.subscription_status = "active" THEN
        ( SELECT * FROM standard_user_data WHERE region = 'EU' )
    ELSE
        ( SELECT * FROM unauthorized_user_data )
    END
ELSE
    ( SELECT * FROM unknown_scope_data )
END
```

If-else statements can also be used as subqueries within other statements.
```surql
UPDATE person SET railcard =
	IF age <= 10 THEN
		'junior'
	ELSE IF age <= 21 THEN
		'student'
	ELSE IF age >= 65 THEN
		'senior'
	ELSE
		NULL
	END
;
```
