# `DEFINE TABLE` statement

The `DEFINE TABLE` statement allows you to declare your table by name, enabling you to apply strict controls to a table's schema by making it `SCHEMAFULL`, create a foreign table view, and set permissions specifying what operations can be performed on the field.

## Requirements

- You must be authenticated as a root or namespace user before you can use the `DEFINE TABLE` statement.
- [You must select your namespace and database](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/use) before you can use the `DEFINE TABLE` statement.

## Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
DEFINE TABLE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] @name
	[ DROP ]
	[ SCHEMAFULL | SCHEMALESS ]
	[ TYPE [ ANY | NORMAL | RELATION [ IN | FROM ] @table [ OUT | TO ] @table ] ]
	[ AS SELECT @projections
		FROM @tables
		[ WHERE @condition ]
		[ GROUP [ BY ] @groups ]
	]
	[CHANGEFEED @duration [INCLUDE ORIGINAL] ]
	[ PERMISSIONS [ NONE | FULL
		| FOR select @expression
		| FOR create @expression
		| FOR update @expression
		| FOR delete @expression
	] ]
```

## Example usage 
Below shows how you can create a table using the `DEFINE TABLE` statement.

```surql
-- Declare the name of a table.
DEFINE TABLE reading;
```
### Using `DROP` clause

The following example uses the `DROP` portion of the `DEFINE TABLE` statement. Marking a table as `DROP` disallows creating or updating records.

`DROP` tables are useful in combination with events or foreign (view) tables, as you can compute a record and essentially drop the input.

```surql
-- By marking a table as DROP, you disallow any records to be created or updated.
-- Records that currently exist in the table will not automatically be deleted, you can still remove them manually.
DEFINE TABLE reading DROP;
```

### Using `CHANGEFEED` clause
The following expression shows how you can define a `CHANGEFEED` for a table. After creating, updating, and deleting records in the table as usual, using [`SHOW CHANGES FOR TABLE`](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/show) will show the changes that have taken place during this time.

## Using `IF NOT EXISTS` clause <l className='purple'>Since 1.3.0</l>

The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause can be used to define a table only if it does not already exist. If the table already exists, the `DEFINE TABLE` statement will return an error.

```surql
-- Create a TABLE if it does not already exist
DEFINE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reading 
```

## Schemafull tables

The following example demonstrates the `SCHEMAFULL` portion of the `DEFINE TABLE` statement. When a table is defined as schemafull, the database strictly enforces any schema definitions that are specified using the `DEFINE TABLE` statement. New fields can not be added to a `SCHEMAFULL` table unless they are defined via the [`DEFINE FIELD`](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/define/field) statement.

```surql
-- Create schemafull user table.
DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMAFULL;

-- Define some fields.
DEFINE FIELD firstName ON TABLE user TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD lastName ON TABLE user TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD email ON TABLE user TYPE string
  ASSERT string::is::email($value);
DEFINE INDEX userEmailIndex ON TABLE user COLUMNS email UNIQUE;

-- SEE IT IN ACTION
-- 1: Add a user with all required fields and an undefined one, 'photoURI'.
CREATE user CONTENT {
    firstName: 'Tobie',
    lastName: 'Hitchcock',
    email: 'Tobie.Hitchcock@surrealdb.com',
    photoURI: 'photo/yxCFi22Jw2.webp'
};
-- 2: Statement will not fail but photoURI will be ignored as it is not a
--    defined field.

-- 3: Query the data
SELECT * FROM user
```

## Schemaless tables

The following example demonstrates the `SCHEMALESS` portion of the `DEFINE TABLE` statement. This allows you to explicitly state that the specified table has no schema.

```surql
-- Create schemaless user table.
DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMALESS;

-- Define some fields.
DEFINE FIELD firstName ON TABLE user TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD lastName ON TABLE user TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD email ON TABLE user TYPE string
  ASSERT string::is::email($value);
DEFINE INDEX userEmailIndex ON TABLE user COLUMNS email UNIQUE;

-- SEE IT IN ACTION - Example 1
-- 1: Add a user with all required fields and an undefined one.
CREATE user SET firstName = 'Tobie', lastName = 'Hitchcock', email = 'Tobie.Hitchcock@surrealdb.com', photoURI = 'photo/yxCFi22Jw2.webp';
-- 2: Statement will succeed because user is a SCHEMALESS table.

-- SEE IT IN ACTION - Example 2
-- 1: Add a user with an invalid email address and include a new field that was never defined.
CREATE user SET firstName = 'Jamie', lastName = 'Hitchcock', email = 'Jamie.Hitchcock', photoURI = 'photo/yxCFi22Jw2.webp';
-- 2: Statement will fail because the value for email was not valid.
```

## Pre-computed table views
The following shows how to make a table view using the `DEFINE TABLE` statement. This is similar to making a view in Relational databases.

## Defining permissions

The following shows how to set table level `PERMISSIONS` using the `DEFINE TABLE` statement. This allows you to set independent permissions for selecting, creating, updating, and deleting data.


```surql
-- Specify access permissions for the 'post' table
DEFINE TABLE post SCHEMALESS
	PERMISSIONS
		FOR select
			-- Published posts can be selected
			WHERE published = true
			-- A user can select all their own posts
			OR user = $auth.id
		FOR create, update
			-- A user can create or update their own posts
			WHERE user = $auth.id
		FOR delete
			-- A user can delete their own posts
			WHERE user = $auth.id
			-- Or an admin can delete any posts
			OR $auth.admin = true
;
```

## Table with specialized `TYPE`-clause <l className='purple'>Since 1.4.0</l>

With `TYPE ANY`, both relations and "normal" data can be stored on a table. Due to SurrealDB's schemaless nature, this is the default option if no `TYPE`-clause is specified.

```surql
DEFINE TABLE person TYPE ANY;
-- Since it's default, we can also omit it.
DEFINE TABLE person;
```

With `TYPE NORMAL`, you can specify a table to only store "normal" records, and not relations.

```surql
DEFINE TABLE person TYPE NORMAL;
```

With `TYPE RELATION`, you can specify a table to only store relation type content, and restrict what kind of relations can be stored.

```surql
-- Just a RELATION table, no constraints on the type of table
DEFINE TABLE likes TYPE RELATION;

-- Define a relation table, and constraint the type of relation which can be stored
DEFINE TABLE likes TYPE RELATION FROM user TO post;
```

```surql
-- 
DEFINE TABLE assigned_to SCHEMAFULL TYPE RELATION IN tag OUT sticky
    PERMISSIONS
        FOR create, select, update, delete 
            WHERE in.owner == $auth.id AND out.author == $auth.id;
```
