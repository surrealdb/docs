# Arrays

Arrays in SurrealDB can any values, with no limit to their depth.

```surql
CREATE person SET results = [
	{ score: 76, date: "2017-06-18T08:00:00Z", name: "Algorithmics" },
	{ score: 83, date: "2018-03-21T08:00:00Z", name: "Concurrent Programming" },
	{ score: 69, date: "2018-09-17T08:00:00Z", name: "Advanced Computer Science 101" },
	{ score: 73, date: "2019-04-20T08:00:00Z", name: "Distributed Databases" },
];
```

```surql
CREATE location SET coordinates = [
	[
		[
			[40.0, 40.0],
			[20.0, 45.0],
			[45.0, 30.0],
			[40.0, 40.0]
		]
	], 
	[
		[
			[20.0, 35.0],
			[10.0, 30.0],
			[10.0, 10.0],
			[30.0, 5.0],
			[45.0, 20.0],
			[20.0, 35.0]
		],
		[
			[30.0, 20.0],
			[20.0, 15.0],
			[20.0, 25.0],
			[30.0, 20.0]
		]
	]
];
```

## Array sorting

Arrays can be sorted and compared. This is done one index at a time, starting with the first.

Returns `true` because 1 is greater than 0:

```surql
RETURN [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] > [0, 100, 100, 100, 100];
```

Returns `false` because 1 is equal to 1, after which the next index is compared: 0 which is less than 100.

```surql
RETURN [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] > [1, 100, 100, 100, 100];
```

As arrays can be used as record IDs, this sorting behaviour allows you to customize sorting behaviour in queries.

```surql
INSERT INTO measurement (id) VALUES
    ([ weather_station:1, '2024-05-15T04:00:24.420Z' ]),
    ([ weather_station:1, '2024-05-14T04:00:24.420Z' ]),
    ([ weather_station:1, '2024-05-13T04:00:24.420Z' ]),
    ([ weather_station:2, '2024-05-15T04:00:24.420Z' ]),
    ([ weather_station:2, '2024-05-14T04:00:24.420Z' ]),
    ([ weather_station:2, '2024-05-13T04:00:24.420Z' ]);

LET $start = time::now() - 5y;
LET $end = time::now() + 5y;
LET $ws = weather_station:1;

SELECT * FROM measurement:[ $ws, $start ]..=[ $ws, $end ];
```

```bash title="Response"
[
	{
		id: measurement:[
			weather_station:1,
			'2024-05-13T04:00:24.420Z'
		]
	},
	{
		id: measurement:[
			weather_station:1,
			'2024-05-14T04:00:24.420Z'
		]
	},
	{
		id: measurement:[
			weather_station:1,
			'2024-05-15T04:00:24.420Z'
		]
	}
]
```
