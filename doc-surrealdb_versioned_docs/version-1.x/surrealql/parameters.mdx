# Parameters

Parameters can be used like variables to store a value which can then be used in subsequent queries. To define a parameter in SurrealQL, use the [`LET`](../surrealql/statements/let) statement. The name of the parameter should begin with a `$` character.

## Defining parameters within SurrealQL

```surql
-- Define the parameter
LET $surname = "Morgan Hitchcock";
-- Use the parameter
CREATE person SET name = "Tobie " + $surname;
CREATE person SET name = "Jaime " + $surname;
```

```bash title="Response"
[
    {
        "id": "person:3vs17lb9eso9m7gd8mml",
        "name": "Tobie Morgan Hitchcock"
    }
]

[
    {
        "id": "person:xh4zbns5mgmywe6bo1pi",
        "name": "Jaime Morgan Hitchcock"
    }
]
```

A parameter can store any value, including the result of a query.

```surql
-- Assuming the CREATE statements from the previous example
LET $founders = (SELECT * FROM person);
RETURN $founders.name;
```

```bash title="Response"
[
    "Tobie Morgan Hitchcock",
    "Jaime Morgan Hitchcock"
]
```

Parameters can be defined using SurrealQL as shown above, or can be passed in using the client libraries as request variables.

## Defining parameters within client libraries
SurrealDB's client libraries allow parameters to be passed in as JSON values, which are then converted to SurrealDB data types when the query is run. The following example show a variable being used within a SurrealQL query from the JavaScript library.

```javascript
let people = await surreal.query("SELECT * FROM article WHERE status INSIDE $status", {
	status: ["live", "draft"],
});
```

## Reserved variable names
SurrealDB uses predefined variables. For that purpose, you can use those variables inside your query but you cannot declare new parameters using one of the following names:

### $auth

Represents the currently authenticated scope user.

```surql
DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMAFULL
	PERMISSIONS
		FOR select, update, delete WHERE id = $auth.id;
```

### $token

Represents values held inside the JWT token used for the current session.

```surql
DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMAFULL
  PERMISSIONS FOR select, update, delete, create
  WHERE $scope = "users"
  AND email = $token.email
;
```

### $scope

Represents the name of the scope of a currently authenticated scope user.

```surql
IF $scope = "admin" THEN
	( SELECT * FROM account )
ELSE IF $scope = "user" THEN
	( SELECT * FROM $auth.account )
ELSE
	[]
END
```

### $session

Represents values from the session functions as an object.

```surql
CREATE user SET 
    name = "Some User",
    on_database = (SELECT VALUE db FROM ONLY $session);
```

```bash title="Response"
[
    {
        "id": "user:wa3ajflozlqoyurc4i4v",
        "name": "Some User",
        "on_database": "database"
    }
]
```

### $before, $after

Represent the values before and after a mutation on a field.

```surql
CREATE cat SET name = "Mr. Meow", nicknames = ["Mr. Cuddlebun"];
UPDATE cat SET nicknames += "Snuggles" WHERE name = "Mr. Meow" RETURN $before, $after;
```

```bash title="Response"
[
    {
        "after": {
            "id": "cat:6p71csv2zqianixf0dkz",
            "name": "Mr. Meow",
            "nicknames": [
                "Mr. Cuddlebun",
                "Snuggles"
            ]
        },
        "before": {
            "id": "cat:6p71csv2zqianixf0dkz",
            "name": "Mr. Meow",
            "nicknames": [
                "Mr. Cuddlebun"
            ]
        }
    }
]
```

### $value

Represents the value after a mutation on a field (identical to $after in the case of an event).


```surql
DEFINE EVENT email ON TABLE user WHEN $before.email != $after.email THEN (
	CREATE event SET 
        user = $value.id,
        time = time::now(),
        value = $after.email,
        action = 'email_changed'
);
```

### $input

Represents the initially inputted value in a field definition, as the value clause could have modified the $value variable.

### $this

Represents the current record in a subquery.

### $parent

Represents the parent record in a subquery.

```surql
CREATE user SET name = "User1", member_of = "group1";
CREATE user SET name = "User2", member_of = "group1";
CREATE user SET name = "User3", member_of = "group1";
SELECT name, 
    (SELECT VALUE name FROM user WHERE member_of = $parent.member_of)
    AS group_members
    FROM user
    WHERE name = "User1";
```

```bash title="Response"
[
    {
        "group_members": [
            "User1",
            "User3",
            "User2"
        ],
        "name": "User1"
    }
]
```

### $event

Represents the type of table event triggered on an event.

```surql
DEFINE EVENT user_created ON TABLE user WHEN $event = "CREATE" THEN (
    CREATE log SET table = "user", event = $event, created_at = time::now()
);
```
