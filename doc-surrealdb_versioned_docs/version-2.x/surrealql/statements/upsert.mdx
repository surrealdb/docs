# `UPSERT` statement

The `UPSERT` statement can be used to modify records in the database if they already exist. If the record does not exist, it will be created.

This is different from the [`UPDATE`](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/surrealql/statements/update) statement, which will fail if the record does not exist.


### Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
UPSERT [ ONLY ] @targets
    [ CONTENT @value
      | MERGE @value
      | PATCH @value
      | SET @field = @value ...
    ]
    [ WHERE @condition ]
    [ RETURN NONE | RETURN BEFORE | RETURN AFTER | RETURN DIFF | RETURN @statement_param, ... ]
    [ TIMEOUT @duration ]
    [ PARALLEL ]
;
```
## Example usage

For example, if you want to update a record if it exists, or create it if it does not, you can use the `UPSERT` statement.

```surql
-- Update or create a record with a specific numeric id
UPSERT person:100 SET name = 'Tobie', company = 'SurrealDB', skills = ['Rust', 'Go', 'JavaScript'];
```
The `UPSERT` statement can be used to modify records in the database if they already exist. If the record does not exist, it will be created.

In the case where the record ID isn't specified, any exisiting records in the table will be updated. For example, the following query will update all records in the `person` table:

```surql
-- Update all records in a table
-- The skills field is an array. The += operator alone is enough for SurrealDB to infer the type
UPSERT person SET skills += 'breathing';
```

The `UPSERT` statement supports conditional matching using the `WHERE` clause. For example, the following query will update the record with the specified ID only if the `name` field is equal to 'Tobie':
  
```surql
-- Update a record with a specific numeric id only if the name is 'Tobie'
UPSERT person:100 SET name = 'Tobie', company = 'SurrealDB', skills = ['Rust', 'Go', 'JavaScript'] WHERE name = 'Tobie';
```
