# `DEFINE INDEX` statement

Just like in other databases, SurrealDB uses indexes to help optimize query performance. An index can consist of one or more fields in a table and can enforce a uniqueness constraint. If you don't intend for your index to have a uniqueness constraint, then the fields you select for your index should have a high degree of cardinality, meaning that there is a high amount of diversity between the data in the indexed table records.

## Requirements

- You must be authenticated as a root or namespace user before you can use the `DEFINE INDEX` statement.
- [You must select your namespace and database](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/surrealql/statements/use) before you can use the `DEFINE INDEX` statement.

## Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
DEFINE INDEX [ IF NOT EXISTS ] @name ON [ TABLE ] @table [ FIELDS | COLUMNS ] @fields
	[ UNIQUE | SEARCH ANALYZER @analyzer [ BM25 [(@k1, @b)] ] [ HIGHLIGHTS ] [ MTREE DIMENSION ] @dimension ]
```

## Index Types
SurrealDB offers a range of indexing capabilities designed to optimize data retrieval and search efficiency.

### Unique Index

Ensures each value in the index is unique. A unique index helps enforce uniqueness across records by preventing duplicate entries in fields such as user IDs, email addresses, and other unique identifiers.

Let's create a unique index for the email address field on a user table.

```surql
-- Makes sure that the email address in the user table is always unique
DEFINE INDEX userEmailIndex ON TABLE user COLUMNS email UNIQUE;
```

The created index can be tested using the [`INFO` statement](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/surrealql/statements/info/).
```surql
INFO FOR TABLE user;
```
The `INFO` statement will help you understand what indexes are defined in your `TABLE`.

```surql
{
    "events": {},
    "fields": {},
    "indexes": {
        "userEmailIndex": "DEFINE INDEX userEmailIndex ON user FIELDS email UNIQUE"
    },
    "lives": {},
    "tables": {}
}
```

As we defined a `UNIQUE` index on the `email` column, a duplicate entry for that column or field will throw an error. 

```surql
-- Create a user record and set an email ID. 
CREATE user:1 SET email = 'test@surrealdb.com';
```

```bash title="Response"
[
    {
        "email": "test@surrealdb.com",
        "id": "user:1"
    }
]
```
Creating another record with the same email ID will throw an error. 

```surql
-- Create another user record and set the same email ID.
CREATE user:2 SET email = 'test@surrealdb.com';
```

```bash title="Response"
Database index `userEmailIndex` already contains 'test@surrealdb.com', 
with record `user:1`
```

To set the same email for `user:2`, the original record must be deleted

```surql
DELETE user:1;
CREATE user:2 SET email = 'test@surrealdb.com'
```
```
[
    {
        "email": "test@surrealdb.com",
        "id": "user:2"
    }
]
```

### Non-Unique Index
This allows for the indexing of attributes that may have non-unique values, facilitating efficient data retrieval. Non-unique indexes help index frequently appearing data in queries that do not require uniqueness, such as categorization tags or status indicators.

Let's create a non-unique index for an age field on a user table.

```surql
-- optimise queries looking for users of a given age
DEFINE INDEX userAgeIndex ON TABLE user COLUMNS age;
```

### Composite Index

The composite index spans multiple fields and columns of a table. Similar to a single field index, composite indexes can also be `UNIQUE` 

```surql
-- Create an index on the account and email fields of the user table
DEFINE INDEX test ON user FIELDS account, email;
```

### Full-Text Search Index

Enables efficient searching through textual data, supporting advanced text-matching features like proximity searches and keyword highlighting.

The [Full-Text search](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/reference-guide/full-text-search) index helps implement comprehensive search functionalities in applications, such as searching through articles, product descriptions, and user-generated content.

Let's create a full-text search index for a name field on a user table.

```surql
-- Allow full-text search queries on the name of the user
DEFINE INDEX userNameIndex ON TABLE user COLUMNS name SEARCH ANALYZER ascii BM25 HIGHLIGHTS;
```

## Vector Search Indexes

Vector search indexes in SurrealDB support efficient [k-nearest neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) (kNN) and [Approximate Nearest Neighbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search) (ANN) operations, which are pivotal in performing similarity searches within complex, high-dimensional datasets and data types.


### M-Tree index

The M-Tree index is suitable for the task of finding exact nearest neighbors based on a distance metric (like Euclidean distance). Mtree currently supports [Euclidean](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/surrealql/functions/database/vector#vectordistanceeuclidean), [Cosine](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/surrealql/functions/database/vector#vectorsimilaritycosine), [Manhattan](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/surrealql/functions/database/vector#vectordistancemanhattan) and [Minkowski](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/surrealql/functions/database/vector#vectordistanceminkowski) distance functions. In SurrealDB, you can also use an M-Tree based index to perform the search. 

:::note 
_Note:_ When no function is specified it chooses Euclidean for the default distance function. 
:::


For example, consider a record with 4 dimensional vectors.

```surql
CREATE pts:1 SET point = [1,2,3,4];
CREATE pts:2 SET point = [4,5,6,7];
CREATE pts:3 SET point = [8,9,10,11];
```

To define an M-tree index on the `point` field of the `pts` table, you can use the query below: 

```surql
DEFINE INDEX mt_pt ON pts FIELDS point MTREE DIMENSION 4;
```

In the above example, the `MTREE DIMENSION` clause specifies the dimension of the vector. The `point` field is a 4-dimensional vector array, so we set the dimension to `4`. If this is sucessfully created, you can use the index to perform vector searches to find records based on the distance from a given point.

In the example below, the query searches for points closest to the vector `[2,3,4,5]` and uses [vector functions](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/surrealql/functions/database/vector) to calculate the distance between two points, indicated by `<|2|>`. 

```surql
LET $pt = [2,3,4,5];
SELECT id, vector::distance::euclidean(point, $pt) AS dist FROM pts WHERE point <|2|> $pt
```

```Json title="Output"
[
    {
        "dist": 2,
        "id": "pts:1"
    },
    {
        "dist": 4,
        "id": "pts:2"
    }
]
```

## Verifying Index Utilization in Queries

The [`EXPLAIN` clause](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/surrealql/statements/select#the-explain-clause) from SurrealQL helps you understand the execution plan of the query and provides transparency around index utilization. 

```surql
SELECT * FROM user WHERE email='test@surrealdb.com' EXPLAIN FULL;
```

It also reveals details about which `operation` was used by the query planner and how many records matched the search criteria. 

```surql
[
    {
        "detail": {
            "plan": {
                "index": "userEmailIndex",
                "operator": "=",
                "value": "test@surrealdb.com"
            },
            "table": "user"
        },
        "operation": "Iterate Index"
    },
    {
        "detail": {
            "count": 1
        },
        "operation": "Fetch"
    }
]
```

## Using `IF NOT EXISTS` clause <l className='purple'>Since 1.3.0</l>

The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause can be used to define a index only if it does not already exist. If the index already exists, the `DEFINE INDEX` statement will return an error.

```surql
-- Create a INDEX if it does not already exist
DEFINE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS example ON example FIELDS example;

```

## Performance Implications

When defining indexes, it's essential to consider the fields most frequently queried or used to optimize performance.

Indexes may improve the performance of SurrealQL statements. This may not be noticeable with small tables but it can be significant for large tables; especially when the indexed fields are used in the `WHERE` clause of a [`SELECT`](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/surrealql/statements/insert/) statement.

Indexes can also impact the performance of write operations ([INSERT](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/surrealql/statements/insert/), [UPDATE](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/surrealql/statements/update), [DELETE](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/surrealql/statements/delete)) since the index needs to be updated accordingly. Therefore, it's essential to balance the need for read performance with write performance.
