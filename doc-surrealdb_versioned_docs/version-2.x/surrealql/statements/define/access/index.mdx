# `DEFINE ACCESS` statement

Defining an access method allows SurrealDB to grant access to resources using different kinds of credentials.

## Requirements

- You must be authenticated as a system user at the same level or higher than the level at which you want to provide access.

## Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
DEFINE ACCESS [ IF NOT EXISTS ] @name
  ON [ ROOT | NAMESPACE | DATABASE ]
  TYPE [
    JWT
      [ ALGORITHM @algorithm KEY @key | JWKS @url ]
      [ WITH ISSUER KEY @key ]
  | RECORD
      [ SIGNUP @expression ]
      [ SIGNIN @expression ]
      [ WITH JWT
        [ ALGORITHM @algorithm KEY @key | URL @url ]
        [ WITH ISSUER KEY @key ]
  ]
  [ DURATION [ FOR TOKEN @duration [ , ] ] [ FOR SESSION @duration ] ]
```

## JSON Web Token (JWT) Access

A JWT access method allows accessing SurrealDB with a token signed by a trusted issuer. The contents of the token will be trusted by SurrealDB as long as it has been signed with the defined key or key pair. 

## Record Access

A record access method allows accessing SurrealDB as a record user. Record users are restricted by permission clauses which enable fine-grained access to tables and fields. This enables using SurrealDB as a web database.

## Duration

The duration clause specifies the duration of the token returned after successful authentication with the access method as well as the duration of the session established both using the access method and the aforementioned token. The difference between these concepts is explained in the [expiration](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/security/authentication#expiration) documentation.

## Using `IF NOT EXISTS` clause

The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause can be used to define an access method only if it does not already exist. If the access method already exists, the `DEFINE ACCESS` statement will return an error.

```surql
-- Create an ACESS if it does not already exist
DEFINE ACCESS IF NOT EXISTS example;
```
