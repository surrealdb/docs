# `DEFINE ACCESS` statement

Defining an access method allows SurrealDB to grant access to resources using different kinds of credentials.

## Requirements

- You must be authenticated as a system user at the same level or higher than the level where you want to `DEFINE ACCES` for.

## Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
DEFINE ACCESS [ IF NOT EXISTS ] @name
  ON [ ROOT | NAMESPACE | DATABASE ]
  TYPE [
    JWT
      [ ALGORITHM @algorithm KEY @key | URL @url ]
      [ WITH ISSUER KEY @key [ DURATION @duration ] ]
  | RECORD
      [ DURATION @duration ]
      [ SIGNUP @expression ]
      [ SIGNIN @expression ]
      [ WITH JWT
        [ ALGORITHM @algorithm KEY @key | URL @url ]
        [ WITH ISSUER KEY @key [ DURATION @duration ] ]
  ]
```

## JSON Web Token (JWT) Access

A JWT access method allows accessing SurrealDB with a token signed by a trusted issuer. The contents of the token will be trusted by SurrealDB as long as it has been signed with the defined key or key pair. 

## Record Access

A record access method allows accessing SurrealDB as a record user. Record users are restricted by permission clauses which enable fine-grained access to tables and fields. This enables using SurrealDB as a web database.

### Example

Below shows how you can enable record access using the `DEFINE ACCESS` statement.

```surql
DEFINE ACCESS account ON DATABASE TYPE RECORD DURATION 24h
	SIGNUP ( CREATE user SET email = $email, pass = crypto::argon2::generate($pass) )
	SIGNIN ( SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = $email AND crypto::argon2::compare(pass, $pass) )
;
```

## Using `IF NOT EXISTS` clause <l className='purple'>Since 1.3.0</l>

The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause can be used to define an access method only if it does not already exist. If the access method already exists, the `DEFINE ACCESS` statement will return an error.

```surql
-- Create an ACESS if it does not already exist
DEFINE ACCESS IF NOT EXISTS example;
```
