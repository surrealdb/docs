# `SLEEP` statement

The `SLEEP` statement is used to introduce a delay or pause in the execution of a query or a batch of queries for a specific amount of time.

### Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
SLEEP @duration;
```

## Example usage

The following query shows example usage of this statement.

```surql
-- Sleep one second
SLEEP 1s;
-- Sleep 100 milliseconds
SLEEP 100ms;
```

## Use cases

`SLEEP` can be useful in a small number of situations, such as:

* Testing and debugging: can be used to understand how concurrent transactions interact, test how systems handle timeouts and delays, simulate behaviour in more distant regions with longer latency
* Throttling: can be used to throttle the execution of operations to prevent the database from being overwhelmed by too many requests at once
* Security measures: can be used to slow down the response rate of login attempts to mitigate the risk of brute force attacks
