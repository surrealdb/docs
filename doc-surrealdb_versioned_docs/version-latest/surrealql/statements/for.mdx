# `FOR` statement

The `FOR` statement can be used to iterate over the values of an array, and to perform certain actions with those values.

:::note
___NOTE:___ A `FOR` loop currently cannot access items outside its own scope, such as variables declared before the loop.
:::

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
FOR @item IN @iterable {
@block
};
```

## Example usage
The following query shows example usage of this statement.

```surql
-- Create a person for everyone in the array
FOR $name IN ['Tobie', 'Jaime'] {
	CREATE type::thing('person', $name) CONTENT {
		name: $name
	};
};
```

The following query shows the `FOR` statement being used update a property on every user matching certain criteria.

```surql
-- Set can_vote to true for every person over 18 years old.
FOR $person IN (SELECT VALUE id FROM person WHERE age >= 18) {
	UPDATE $person SET can_vote = true;
};
```
