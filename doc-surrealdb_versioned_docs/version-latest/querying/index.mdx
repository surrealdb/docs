# Querying Data in SurrealDB

In this section, you will explore some of the ways you can query data in SurrealDB using SurrealQL, GraphQL (experimental) or via any of the available SDKs. Regardless of the method you choose, SurrealDB provides powerful querying capabilities that allow you to retrieve, filter, and manipulate data efficiently and effectively. 

Now, let's explore the different methods to query data in SurrealDB.

## SurrealQL

[SurrealQL](/docs/surrealql) is our powerful database query language that closely resembles traditional SQL but comes with unique differences and improvements.

Designed to provide developers with a seamless and intuitive way to interact with SurrealDB, SurrealQL offers a familiar syntax and supports various statement types, allowing you to perform complex database operations efficiently.

To get started with SurrealQL, you can explore the various [statement types](/docs/surrealql/statements) available. These statements enable you to perform a wide range of database operations, from querying data to modifying records and managing database structures.

Additionally, SurrealQL provides a rich set of [database functions](/docs/surrealql/functions/database) that enhance its capabilities. These functions allow you to perform advanced operations and leverage the full potential of SurrealDB's features. Whether you are working with data retrieval, manipulation, or complex computations, SurrealQL's functions offer the tools you need to build robust and scalable applications.


### Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with SurrealQL is to use [Surrealist](https://surrealist.app/). This interactive environment allows you to experiment with SurrealQL statements and see the results immediately. You can use Surrealist to learn about the syntax and features of SurrealQL and to develop your queries and scripts.

To familiarize yourself with SurrealQL, explore the various [statement](/docs/surrealql/statements) and their syntax. The statements pages provides comprehensive examples and explanations for each statement type, helping you understand how to construct queries and interact with SurrealDB effectively.

SurrealQL empowers you to leverage the full potential of SurrealDB and enables you to build robust and scalable applications. Let's dive into the world of SurrealQL and unlock the capabilities of SurrealDB together!

### Querying Options

When using SurrealQL, there are several options available to interact with your database instance depending on your environment and needs. 

- **WebSocket**: SurrealDB supports WebSocket connections, allowing you to execute SurrealQL queries in real-time. This option is ideal for applications that require low-latency communication and real-time updates.

- **CLI**: The SurrealDB Command Line Interface (CLI) provides a powerful way to interact with the database directly from your terminal. You can execute SurrealQL queries, manage database structures, and perform administrative tasks using the CLI.

- **Surrealist**: [Surrealist](https://surrealist.app/) is an interactive environment that allows you to experiment with SurrealQL statements and see the results immediately. It is a great tool for learning about the syntax and features of SurrealQL and for developing your queries and scripts.

- **HTTP**: You can send HTTP requests to the [`/sql` endpoint](/docs/surrealdb/integration/http#sql) to execute SurrealQL queries. This method is useful for integrating SurrealDB with web applications and services that communicate over HTTP.

    - **Postman**: You can also query SurrealDB using Postman and RPC (Remote Procedure Call). These methods provide flexibility and can be useful for testing and automation purposes.
- **RPC**: SurrealDB also supports RPC, allowing you to interact with the database programmatically over a network.

#### Using Postman

Postman is a popular tool for testing APIs. You can use it to send HTTP requests to your SurrealDB instance and perform various database operations.

1. **Set up Postman**: Download and install Postman from the [official website](https://www.postman.com/).

2. **Create a new request**: Open Postman and create a new HTTP request.

3. **Configure the request**:
   - Set the request method to `POST`.
   - Enter the URL of your SurrealDB instance, e.g., `http://localhost:8000/sql`.
   - In the Headers section, add a `Content-Type` header with the value `application/json`.
   - In the Body section, select `raw` and set the type to `Text`. Enter your SQL query,for example:
     ```json
     INFO for db
     ```

4. **Send the request**: Click the `Send` button to execute the query. You will see the response from SurrealDB in the lower section of the Postman interface.

#### Using RPC

SurrealDB also supports RPC, allowing you to interact with the database programmatically over a network.

1. **Set up an RPC client**: Depending on your programming language, you can use various libraries to create an RPC client. Here is an example using JavaScript with the `node-fetch` library:

   ```javascript
   const fetch = require('node-fetch');

   async function querySurrealDB() {
     // Create a new person record
     await fetch('http://localhost:8000/rpc', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: {
         'Content-Type': 'application/json',
       },
       body: JSON.stringify({
         method: 'query',
         params: ['CREATE person SET name = "John Doe"; SELECT * FROM person;'],
       }),
     });

     const data = await response.json();
     console.log(data);
   }

   querySurrealDB();
   ```

2. **Execute the RPC call**: Run your script to send the RPC request and receive the response from SurrealDB.

By using Postman and RPC, you can easily test and automate your interactions with SurrealDB, making it a versatile tool for various use cases.


## SDKs 

Another way to interact with SurrealDB is to use one of the available SDKs. The SDKs provide a convenient way to query data, insert records, and manage database operations programmatically. 

SurrealDB offers a variety of SDKs that allow you to interact with the database programmatically. These SDKs provide a convenient and efficient way to query data, insert records, and manage database operations using your preferred programming language.

### Available SDKs

SurrealDB supports SDKs for several popular programming languages, including:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: The [JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](/docs/sdk/javascript/core/initialization) allows you to interact with SurrealDB from web applications, Node.js environments, and other JavaScript-based platforms. It provides a comprehensive set of methods to perform queries, manage records, and handle database transactions.

- **Python**: The [Python SDK](/docs/sdk/python/setup) offers a seamless way to integrate SurrealDB with your Python applications. Whether you are building web applications, data analysis tools, or automation scripts, the Python SDK provides the necessary functions to interact with the database efficiently.

- **.NET**: The [.NET SDK](/docs/sdk/dotnet) allows you to interact with SurrealDB using the .NET framework. It provides a comprehensive set of methods to perform queries, manage records, and handle database transactions, making it suitable for building robust and scalable applications.

- **Rust**: The [Rust SDK](/docs/sdk/rust/setup) leverages the safety and performance features of the Rust programming language. It allows you to interact with SurrealDB in a type-safe manner, ensuring that your database operations are both efficient and reliable.

### Getting Started with SDKs

To get started with any of the SDKs, you need to install the appropriate package for your programming language. Once installed, you can initialize the SDK and connect to your SurrealDB instance. Here is an example of how to get started with the JavaScript SDK:

```javascript
import { Surreal } from 'surrealdb';

const db = new Surreal('http://localhost:8000');

await db.connect('root', 'root');

type Person = {
	id: string;
	name: string;
};

// Assign the variable on the connection
const result = await db.query<[Person[], Person[]]>(
	'CREATE person SET name = "John"; SELECT * FROM type::table($tb);',
	{ tb: 'person' }
);

// Get all of the results from the second query
const people = result[1].result;
```
