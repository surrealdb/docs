# GraphQL via Surrealist 

In this section, you will explore writing GraphQL queries in [Surrealist](https://surrealist.app/query). The GraphQL query view in Surrealist provides a rich set of features, including syntax highlighting, query validation, and query execution. You can also view the query results in a tabular format, making it easy to analyze and visualize the data.

## Getting Started

Before you can start making queries, you need to start SurrealDB with the GraphQL module enabled. You can do this by setting the `SURREAL_EXPERIMENTAL_GRAPHQL` [environment variable](/docs/surrealdb/installation/running/env_vars) to `true` and starting a new instance of SurrealDB with the [`surreal start` command](/docs/surrealdb/cli/start).

```bash
SURREAL_EXPERIMENTAL_GRAPHQL=true surreal start --log debug --user root --password root
```

:::note
__Note:__ By running SurrealDB with the GraphQL module enabled, you are opting into an experimental feature. While the GraphQL module is fully functional, it is still considered experimental and may not be as stable as the core SurrealQL module. We welcome your feedback and contributions to help improve the feature and make it more robust. 

GraphQL is a pre-release feature with known security flaws. This is not recommended for production use

After starting the SurrealDB instance, you can navigate to the Surrealist to start a new connection. 

### Start a new connection

In the top left corner of the Surrealist, start a new connection. Ensure that the connection information is the same as the one you used to start the SurrealDB instance. In the example above we have set the user to `root` and the password to `root`.

### Setting a namespace and database

Before you can start writing queries, you need to set the namespace and database. For example you can set the namespace to `test` and the database to `test`. This will set the namespace and database for the current connection.

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('img/surrealist-connection.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('img/surrealist-connection.png'),
  }}
/>

Next, create some data to query. You can use the [SurrealQL query editor](/docs/surrealist/query) to create some data. For example, you can create a new record in the `person` table.

```sql
CREATE person SET name = "John Doe";
```

## Write your first GraphQL query

After you have created some data, you can start writing GraphQL queries. You can use the [Surrealist GraphQL editor](https://surrealist.app/graphql) to write your GraphQL queries. 

For example, to query the `person` table for all records, you can write the following GraphQL query:

```graphql
query {
  person {
    name
  }
}
```

and to get the person with the name "John Doe", you can write the following GraphQL query:

```graphql
query {
  person(name: "John Doe") {
    name
  }
}
```

Surrealist will automatically validate the query and provide you with the results.
