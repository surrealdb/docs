# Namespace

A namespace in SurrealDB acts as a higher-level container that can hold multiple databases. It is primarily used for organizing and isolating databases within the same SurrealDB instance. This is particularly useful in multi-tenant environments where different applications or groups might need to operate independently within the same server or cluster.

Namespaces help in managing permissions and access at a broader level than individual databases.
There is no limit to the number of namespaces on SurrealDB and each namespace can have its own set of databases, tables, and records.

## Namespace structure

Namespaces are defined using the [`DEFINE NAMESPACE`](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/define/namespace) statement in SurrealQL. The statement requires a unique name for the namespace and can optionally include a comment for additional context. The following is the syntax for defining a namespace:

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
DEFINE NAMESPACE [ OVERWRITE | IF NOT EXISTS ] @name [ COMMENT @string ]
```

You can also view the list of namespaces in your SurrealDB instance using the [`INFO`](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/info) statement. This statement provides information about the accesses, databases, and users present in the current SurrealDB instance.

```bash
{
	databases: {},
	tokens: {},
	users: {}
}
```

## Requirements

- You must be authenticated as a root or namespace user before you can use the `DEFINE NAMESPACE` statement.
