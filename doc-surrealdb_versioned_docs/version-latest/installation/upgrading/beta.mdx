# Upgrading to `2.0.0-beta` 

The `2.0.0-beta` release of SurrealDB includes many new features, improvements, and bug fixes. However, because of changes in the underlying way that SurrealDB stores data, three steps are required to migrate to `2.0.0-beta`. We've listed them below, and we advise following this migration guide whether or not you encounter this issue!

## Issues

- A change in the underlying way data is stored in SurrealDB was caused by how ranges and record IDs are stored in the database. 
    -  [Record IDs now support storing UUIDs instead of strings](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/4491). 
    -  [`Value::Range` stored as just a range instead of a string](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/4506).

### Do I have this issue?

If you are experiencing this issue, an error similar to the following will be thrown when connecting to the database or when selecting specific data.

```bash
error: Storage version is out-of-date.
```

## Moving from 1.x to 2.0.0-beta

A new [`surreal fix`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/fix) command has been implemented to automatically change the format of your stored data. The command is followed by a path to the data. Two examples:

```bash
surreal fix surrealkv://mydata

surreal fix rocksdb:somedatabase
```

## Moving from 2.0.0-alpha to 2.0.0-beta

The `surreal fix` command above has been created specifically for 1.x instances. However, data currently on a `2.0.0-alpha` instance can still be manually exported and then reimported into a project running on `2.0.0-beta` via the following steps.

1. Export your current data as SQL. You can do this using the [`surreal export`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/export) command in the terminal:

```bash
# Example export command to export data to a file called `export.surql` in the downloads directory.
surreal export --conn http://localhost:8000 --user root --pass root --ns test --db test downloads/export.surql
``` 

2. This will create a file called `export.surql` in the current directory.

3. You can now import this file back into your project running on `2.0.0-beta`.


```bash
surreal import --conn http://localhost:8000 --user root --pass root --ns test --db test downloads/export.surql
```


## Check for changes in the release notes

There have been major improvements to SurrealDB in `2.0.0` release both in alpha and beta. Check out the changes on the [release page](https://surrealdb.com/releases).
