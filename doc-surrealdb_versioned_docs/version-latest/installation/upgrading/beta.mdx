# Upgrading to `2.0.0-beta` 

The `2.0.0-beta` release of SurrealDB includes many new features, improvements, and bug fixes. However, because of changes in the underlying way that SurrealDB stores data, three steps are required to migrate to 2.0.0-beta. We've listed them below, and we advise following this migration guide whether or not you encounter this issue!

## Issues

- A change in the underlying way data is stored in SurrealDB was caused by how ranges and record IDs are stored in the database. 
    -  [Record IDs now support storing UUIDs instead of strings](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/4491). 
    -  [`Value::Range` stored as just a range instead of a string](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/4506).

Because of this, data will need to be exported as SQL and imported into `2.0.0-beta`.

### Do I have this issue?

If you are experiencing this issue, an error similar to the following will be thrown when connecting to the database or when selecting specific data.

```bash
error: Storage version is out-of-date.
```

## Handling current data. 

1. Export your current data as SQL. You can do this using the [`surreal export`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/export) command in the terminal:

```bash
# Example export command to export data to a file called `export.surql` in the downloads directory.
surreal export --conn http://localhost:8000 --user root --pass root --ns test --db test downloads/export.surql
``` 

2. This will create a file called `export.surql` in the current directory.

3. You can now import this file back into your project running on `2.0.0-beta`.


```bash
surreal import --conn http://localhost:8000 --user root --pass root --ns test --db test downloads/export.surql
```


## Check for changes in the release notes
