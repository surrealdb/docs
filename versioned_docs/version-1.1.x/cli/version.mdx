# Version Command

The version command outputs the current version of the installed command-line tool, and the machine architecture.

:::note
__BEFORE YOU START :__ Make sure you’ve [installed SurrealDB](/docs/surrealdb/1.1.x/installation/overview/) — it should only take a second!
:::

## Example usage
To display the current command-line tool version, along with the platform and architecture, in a terminal run the surreal version command without any further arguments.

```bash
surreal version
```
