# Strings

# Strings

Strings can be used to store text values. All text fields can include unicode values, emojis, and tabular and multine breaks.

```surql
CREATE person SET text = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet';
```

Strings can be created using single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

```surql
CREATE person SET text = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet";
```

Any string in SurrealDB can include unicode text.

```surql
CREATE person SET text = "I ❤️ SurrealDB";
```

Strings can also include line breaks.

```surql
CREATE person SET text = "This
is
over
multiple
lines";
```

## String prefixes

In SurrealQL, strings can be enthusiastically converted into Record IDs, Datetimes or to UUIDs. 
String prefixes are a solution to this problem, in that you as the developer get to specify what the "string" contains.

### Overview

Here are a couple of examples of how string prefixes work:

```surql
RETURN s"5:20";
RETURN r"person:tobie";
```

### `s` -> string

The `s` prefix tells the parser that the contents of this string is just a string, and likely the most common usecase for string prefixes.

```surql
-- Interpeted as a record ID, because of the structure with the semicolon:
RETURN "5:20";
-- Forcefully parsed as just a string
RETURN s"5:20";
```

### `r` -> record

The `r` prefix tells the parser that the contents of this string is a record ID.

```surql
RETURN r"person:john";
```

### `d` -> datetime

The `d` prefix tells the parser that the contents of this string is a DateTime.

```surql
RETURN d"2023-11-28T11:41:20.262Z";
```

### `u` -> UUID

The `u` prefix tells the parser that the contents of this string is a UUID.

```surql
RETURN u"8c54161f-d4fe-4a74-9409-ed1e137040c1";
```
