# Embedding in Python

SurrealDB is designed to be run in many different ways, and environments. Due to the [separation of the storage and compute](/docs/introduction/architecture) layers, SurrealDB can be run in embedded mode, from within a number of different language environments. In Python, SurrealDB can be run as an in-memory database, or it can persist data using a file-based storage engine. 

The documentation for embedding SurrealDB within Python has not yet been released. In the meantime, please refer to the [Python client SDK](/docs/integration/sdks/python) documentation to get started with connecting to SurrealDB from Python.
