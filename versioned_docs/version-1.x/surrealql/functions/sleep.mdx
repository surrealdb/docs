# Sleep function

These functions can be used to introduce a delay or pause in the execution of a query or a batch of queries for a specific amount of time.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Function</th>
      <th scope="col">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td scope="row" data-label="Function"><a href="#sleep"><code>sleep()</code></a></td>
      <td scope="row" data-label="Description">Delays or pauses in the execution of a query or a batch of queries.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## `sleep`

The `sleep` function delays or pauses the execution of a query or a set of statements.



```surql title="API DEFINITION"
sleep(duration) -> none
```
The following example shows this function, and its output, when used in a [`RETURN`](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/return) statement:

```surql
RETURN sleep(1s);
RETURN sleep(500ms);
```
