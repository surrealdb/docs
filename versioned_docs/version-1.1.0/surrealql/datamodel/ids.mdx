# Record IDs

In SurrealDB, document record IDs store both the table name, and the record ID. Learn more about Reocrd IDs [in this blogpost](https://surrealdb.com/blog/the-life-changing-magic-of-surrealdb-record-ids#the-performance-at-scale) and on this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0cqmWRYP8c).


## Text Record IDs
Without annotation, text record IDs can contain letters, numbers and `_` characters.

```surql 
CREATE company:surrealdb SET name = 'SurrealDB';
```
Record IDs can contain complex characters, surrounded by the <code>`</code>  character.

```surql
CREATE article:`8424486b-85b3-4448-ac8d-5d51083391c7` SET time = time::now(), author = person:tobie;
```
Alternatively complex characters within record IDs can be surrounded by the `⟨` and `⟩` characters.

```surql
CREATE article:⟨8424486b-85b3-4448-ac8d-5d51083391c7⟩ SET time = time::now(), author = person:tobie;
```

If you create a record ID with a number as a string, it will be stored with the `⟨ ⟩` characters to differentiate it from a number.

```surql
CREATE article SET id = "10";
-- becomes: article:⟨10⟩
```

## Numeric Record IDs
If a numeric value is specified without any decimal point suffix and is within the range `-9223372036854775808` to `9223372036854775807` then the value will be parsed, stored, and treated as a 64-bit integer.

```surql
CREATE temperature:17493 SET time = time::now(), celsius = 37.5;
```

## Object-based Record IDs
Complex Record IDs support dynamic expressions, allowing parameters, and function expressions to be used as values within the IDs. This is useful in a timeseries context, or for ensuring locality between specific records in a table.

```surql
// Set a new parameter
LET $now = time::now();
// Create a record with a complex ID using an object
CREATE temperature:{ location: 'London', date: $now } SET
	location = 'London',
	date = $now,
	temperature = 23.7
;
```

## Array-based Record IDs
Similar to Object-based Record IDs, records in SurrealDB can store arrays of values, with no limit to the depth of the arrays. Arrays can store any value stored within them, and can store different value types within the same array.

```surql
// Set a new parameter
LET $now = time::now();
// Create a record with a complex ID using an array
CREATE temperature:['London', $now] SET
	location = 'London',
	date = $now,
	temperature = 23.7
;
```

## Generating Record IDs
Record IDs can be generated with a number of built-in ID generation functions. These allow for Record IDs to be generated using cryptographically-secure randomly-generated identifiers (which are suitable for dispersion across a distributed datastore), sequentially incrementing `ULID` Record identifiers, and `UUID` version 7 Record idenfitifiers.

```surql
// Generate a random Record ID
CREATE temperature:rand() SET time = time::now(), celsius = 37.5;
// Generate a ULID-based Record ID
CREATE temperature:ulid() SET time = time::now(), celsius = 37.5;
// Generate a UUIDv7-based Record ID
CREATE temperature:uuid() SET time = time::now(), celsius = 37.5;
```

## Record ranges
SurrealDB supports the ability to query a range of records, using the record ID. The record ID ranges, retrieve records using the natural sorting order of the record IDs. These range queries can be used to query a range of records in a timeseries context.

```surql
-- Select all person records with IDs between the given range
SELECT * FROM person:1..1000;
-- Select all records for a particular location, inclusive
SELECT * FROM temperature:['London', NONE]..=['London', time::now()];
-- Select all temperature records with IDs less than a maximum value
SELECT * FROM temperature:..['London', '2022-08-29T08:09:31'];
-- Select all temperature records with IDs greater than a minimum value
SELECT * FROM temperature:['London', '2022-08-29T08:03:39']..;
-- Select all temperature records with IDs between the specified range
SELECT * FROM temperature:['London', '2022-08-29T08:03:39']..['London', '2022-08-29T08:09:31'];
```
