# Machine Learning function

## Machine Learning function

These functions can be used when calculating outputs from a trained machine learning model that has
been uploaded to the database

## `ml`

Once a model has been uploaded to the database, the model can be called with inputs resulting in a calculation
from the trained ml model. We can do a basic raw computation with the following call:

```js title="API DEFINITION"
ml::house-price-prediction<0.0.1>(500.0, 1.0);
```
In the above example, the model we are calling is called [`house-price-prediction`] with the version [`0.0.1`]. We
then pass in a raw vector of `[ [500.0, 1.0] ]` Depending on the model, the name and version of the model will vary as well
as the inputs. The name and version of the model will be defined in the [`surml`] file which will defined when uploading the
model to the database. We can also perform a [`buffered compute`] with the code below:

```surql title="API DEFINITION"
ml::house-price-prediction<0.0.1>({squarefoot: 500.0, num_floors: 1.0});
```
Here, we are using the key mappings in the header of the [`.surml`] file uploaded to the database to map the fields defined
in the object passed into the [`ml`] function in the correct order. If there are any normalisation parameters in the header
of the [`.surml`] file, these will also be applied.

The following example shows this function, and its output, when used in a [`RETURN`](/docs/surrealql/statements/return) statement:

```surql 
RETURN ml::house-price-prediction<0.0.1>({squarefoot: 500.0, num_floors: 1.0});

250000
```

Seeing as the ML is integrated into our surql, we can infer entire columns using the ml function. We can demonstrate this with a simple
example of house prices. We can define some basic table with the following surql:

```surql
CREATE house_listing SET squarefoot_col = 500.0, num_floors_col = 1.0;
CREATE house_listing SET squarefoot_col = 1000.0, num_floors_col = 2.0;
CREATE house_listing SET squarefoot_col = 1500.0, num_floors_col = 3.0;
```

We can then get all the rows with the imputed price prediction with the surql below:

```surql
SELECT *, ml::house-price-prediction<0.0.1>({ squarefoot: squarefoot_col, num_floors: num_floors_col }) AS price_prediction FROM house_listing;
```

This would statement gives us the following result:

```json
[
	{
		id: house_listing:7bo0f35tl4hpx5bymq5d,
		num_floors_col: 3f,
		price_prediction: 406534.75f,
		squarefoot_col: 1500f
	},
	{
		id: house_listing:8k2ttvhp2vh8v7skwyie,
		num_floors_col: 2f,
		price_prediction: 291870.5f,
		squarefoot_col: 1000f
	},
	{
		id: house_listing:vnlv3nzr21oi5o23kydw,
		num_floors_col: 1f,
		price_prediction: 177206.21875f,
		squarefoot_col: 500f
	}
]
```

We can see that our price prediction is calculated in the query. We can build on the previous surql to filter based on the computed
price prediction with the surql below:

```surql
SELECT * FROM (SELECT *, ml::house-price-prediction<0.0.1>({ squarefoot: squarefoot_col, num_floors: num_floors_col }) AS price_prediction FROM house_listing) WHERE price_prediction > 177206.21875;
```

This gives us the following result:

```json
[
	{
		id: house_listing:7bo0f35tl4hpx5bymq5d,
		num_floors_col: 3f,
		price_prediction: 406534.75f,
		squarefoot_col: 1500f
	},
	{
		id: house_listing:8k2ttvhp2vh8v7skwyie,
		num_floors_col: 2f,
		price_prediction: 291870.5f,
		squarefoot_col: 1000f
	}
]
```
