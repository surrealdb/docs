# DEFINE INDEX

# `DEFINE INDEX` statement

Just like in other databases, SurrealDB uses indexes to help optimize query performance. An index can consist of one or more fields in a table and can enforce a uniqueness constraint. If you don't intend for your index to have a uniqueness constraint, then the fields you select for your index should have a high degree of cardinality, meaning that there is a high amount of diversity between the data in the indexed table records.

## Requirements
- You must be authenticated as a root or namespace user before you can use the `DEFINE INDEX` statement.
- [You must select your namespace and database](/docs/nightly/surrealql/statements/use) before you can use the `DEFINE INDEX` statement.

## Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
DEFINE INDEX @name ON [ TABLE ] @table [ FIELDS | COLUMNS ] @fields
	[ UNIQUE | SEARCH ANALYZER @analyzer [ BM25 [(@k1, @b)] ] [ HIGHLIGHTS ] ]
```
## Index Types
SurrealDB offers a range of indexing capabilities designed to optimize data retrieval and search efficiency.

### Unique Index

Ensures each value in the index is unique. A Unique index helps enforce uniqueness across records by preventing duplicate entries in fields such as user IDs, email addresses, and other unique identifiers.

Create a unique index for the email address field on a user table.

```surql
-- Makes sure that the email address in the user table is always unique
DEFINE INDEX userEmailIndex ON TABLE user COLUMNS email UNIQUE;
```
Alternatively, `FIELDS` can be used in place of `COLUMN`

The created index can be tested using the [`INFO` statement](/docs/nightly/surrealql/statements/info/).
```surql
INFO FOR TABLE user;
```
The INFO statement will help you understand what indexes are defined in your `TABLE`.

```surql
{
    "events": {},
    "fields": {},
    "indexes": {
        "userEmailIndex": "DEFINE INDEX userEmailIndex ON user FIELDS email UNIQUE"
    },
    "lives": {},
    "tables": {}
}
```

As we defined a `UNIQUE` index on the `email` column, a duplicate entry for that column or field will throw an error. 

```surql
-- Create a user record and set an email ID. 
CREATE user:1 SET email = 'test@surrealdb.com';
```
```
-- Output:
[
    {
        "email": "test@surrealdb.com",
        "id": "user:1"
    }
]
```
Creating another record with the same email ID will throw an error. 

```surql
-- Create another user record and set the same email ID.
CREATE user:2 SET email = 'test@surrealdb.com';
```
```
-- throws an error as we defined a UNIQUE index on the email column
Database index `userEmailIndex` already contains 'test@surrealdb.com', 
with record `user:1`
```

To set the same email for user:2, the original record must be deleted

```surql
DELETE user:1;
CREATE user:2 SET email = 'test@surrealdb.com'
```
```
[
    {
        "email": "test@surrealdb.com",
        "id": "user:2"
    }
]
```

### Non-Unique Index
Allows for the indexing of attributes that may have non-unique values, facilitating efficient data retrieval. Non-unique indexes help index frequently appearing data in queries that do not require uniqueness, such as categorization tags or status indicators.

Create a non-unique index for an age field on a user table.

```surql
-- optimise queries looking for users of a given age
DEFINE INDEX userAgeIndex ON TABLE user COLUMNS age;
```

### Composite Index

The composite index spans multiple fields and columns of a table. Similar to a single field index, composite indexes can also be `UNIQUE` 

```surql
-- Create an index on the account and email fields of the user table
DEFINE INDEX test ON user FIELDS account, email;
```

### Full-Text Search Index

Enables efficient searching through textual data, supporting advanced text-matching features like proximity searches and keyword highlighting.

The [Full-Text search](/docs/nightly/reference-guide/full-text-search) index helps implement comprehensive search functionalities in applications, such as searching through articles, product descriptions, and user-generated content.

Create a full-text search index for a name field on a user table.

```surql
-- Allow full-text search queries on the name of the user
DEFINE INDEX userNameIndex ON TABLE user COLUMNS name SEARCHANALYZER ascii BM25 HIGHLIGHTS;
```

## Verifying Index Utilization in Queries

The [`EXPLAIN` clause](/docs/nightly/surrealql/statements/select/#the-explain-clause) from SurrealQL helps you understand the execution plan of the query and provides transparency around index utilization. 

```surql
SELECT * FROM user WHERE email='test@surrealdb.com' EXPLAIN FULL;
```

It also reveals details about which `operation` was used by the query planner and how many records matched the search criteria. 

```surql
[
    {
        "detail": {
            "plan": {
                "index": "userEmailIndex",
                "operator": "=",
                "value": "test@surrealdb.com"
            },
            "table": "user"
        },
        "operation": "Iterate Index"
    },
    {
        "detail": {
            "count": 1
        },
        "operation": "Fetch"
    }
]
```

When defining indexes, it's essential to consider the fields most frequently queried or used to optimize performance.

Indexes can also impact the performance of write operations ([INSERT](docs/nightly/surrealql/statements/insert/), [UPDATE](/docs/nightly/surrealql/statements/update), [DELETE](/docs/nightly/surrealql/statements/delete)) since the index needs to be updated accordingly. Therefore, it's essential to balance the need for read performance with write performance.
