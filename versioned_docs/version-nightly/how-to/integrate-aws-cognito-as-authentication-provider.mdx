# Integrate AWS Cognito as an Authentication Provider

# Integrate AWS Cognito as an Authentication Provider

This guide will cover using [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) as the authentication provider for client-side web applications using SurrealDB as the only backend. In this guide you will learn how to:

- Configure AWS Cognito to issue tokens that can be used with SurrealDB.
- Configure SurrealDB to accept tokens issued by AWS Cognito.
- Define user-level authorization using SurrealDB scopes.
- Authenticate users with AWS Cognito in a client-side web application.
- Retrieve and update information from SurrealDB using the authenticated user.

This guide will cover the most general case, in which SurrealDB is the only backend for your application. You can still follow this guide even if you have additional backends, but in that case you may have other options available to request and validate tokens issued by AWS Cognito.

## Prerequities

This guide assumes the following: 

- You have a [fresh instance of SurrealDB running](/docs/introduction/start) with version `1.2.0` or later.

- You can [use a local Docker container](/docs/installation/running/docker) without volumes for the purposes of this guide.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always -p 8000:8000 surrealdb/surrealdb:latest \
  start --log trace --auth --user root --pass root
```

To run the SurrealQL statements mentioned in this guide, you will also need an interactive shell.

```bash
surrealql -u root -p root --pretty
```

You will also need to [have an Amazon Web Services account](https://aws.amazon.com/resources/create-account/). By following this guide you will be subject to **at least** the [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/pricing/) and [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/) pricing plans. Although the resources used in this guide should be well within the free tier for both, we cannot guarantee that this will be the case in your particular situation.

## Configuring AWS Cognito 

### Creating a User Pool and a Client

Cognito offers [user pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html) as a user directory for mobile and web applications. This directory can hold users defined directly within Cognito, but can also integrate with third-party identity providers like Google and Facebook. Additionally, it provides the ability to handle user registrations directly in the [Cognito Hosted UI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-app-integration.html), which can also take care of requiring specific information, verifying user email addresses and phone numbers or even enforcing multi-factor authentication. Within a user pool, [creating a client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-client-apps.html#cognito-user-pools-app-idp-settings-console-create) establishes a method (in our case a client-side web application) to authenticate with the user pool.

You will need to [create a user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-as-user-directory.html) that meets your requirements. In order to be able to follow along with this guide, the following configuration options are strongly recommended:

- In the "Configure sign-in experience" step, select at least "Email" in "Cognito user pool sign-in options".
- In the "Configure sign-up experience" step, select at least "email" in "Required attributes".
- In the "Configure sign-up experience" step, select "Allow Cognito to automatically send messages to verify and confirm".
- In the "Configure message delivery" step, select "Send email with Cognito" in "Email".
- In the "Integrate your app" step, select "Use the Cognito Hosted UI" in "Hosted authentication pages". 
- In the "Integrate your app" step, select "Use a Cognito domain" in "Domain" and set a name for it. 
- In the "Integrate your app" step, select "Public client" in "Initial app client". 
- In the "Integrate your app" step, select "Don't generate a client secret" in "Initial app client".
- In the "Integrate your app" step, under "Allowed callback URLs" in "Initial app client", set the URL of your web application.
- In the "Integrate your app" step, under "Advanced app client settings" in "Initial app client", ensure "Authorization code grant" is selected.
- In the "Integrate your app" step, under "Attribute read and write permissions" in "Initial app client", ensure "email" is selected for "Read".
- In the "Integrate your app" step, under "Attribute read and write permissions" in "Initial app client", ensure "email_verified" is selected for "Read".

These suggested configuration options may not provide the strongest security or match your specific requirements, but will ensure that you are able to follow with this guide to understand the simplest example of an integration between SurrealDB and AWS Cognito, which you should later update to meet your requirements. Changes in these options may require changes in the other steps outlined in this guide. Other configuration options can be left with their default values or may be changed to fit your requirements. 

Once you user pool has been created, open it in the AWS Console and take note of the following values:

- "User pool ID" from the "User pool overview" section in the main user pool view.
- "Cognito domain" from the "Configuration for all app clients" section under the "App integration" tab.
- "Client ID" from the only client in the "App client list" under the "App integration" tab.

### Creating a Test User

TBD

### Creating a Pre-Token Generation Lambda

Now, Cognito is ready to perform authentication and issue tokens for your application. However, SurrealDB expects these tokens to contain some specific claims. Cognito allows modifying token claims through [pre-token generation lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-pre-token-generation.html#cognito-user-pools-lambda-trigger-syntax-pre-token-generation) triggers. Specifically, we will be [adding custom claims](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-pre-token-generation.html#aws-lambda-triggers-pre-token-generation-example-2) to the token.

To create the trigger, just [create an AWS Lambda function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html#getting-started-create-function) with the following code:

```js
const handler = async (event) => {
  event.response = {
    claimsOverrideDetails: {
      claimsToAddOrOverride: {
        tk: "cognito",
        ns: "test",
        db: "test",
        sc: "user",
      },
    },
  };

  return event;
};

export { handler };
```

Note that, in order to use the suggested code, the function must be configured as "Node.js 20.x" or equivalent.

You can give it a descriptive name like `AddSurrealDBClaims`. After the Lambda trigger has been created, we will need to [associate it with our client integration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html). Visit your user pool in Cognito and, under the "User pool properties" tab, in the "Lambda triggers" section, click on "Add Lambda trigger". For this guide, the trigger type will be "Authentication", specifically a "Pre token generation trigger".

## Configuring SurrealDB

### Defining a token verification method in SurrealDB

Next, we should configure SurrealDB so that it can verify tokens sent to it through the [HTTP REST API](/docs/integration/http) via the “Authorization” header or through any of the [SDKs](/docs/integration/sdks/Overview) via the “Authenticate” methods.

To do that, we will leverage the JWKS support in SurrealDB in order to define a token verification mechanism pointing to a JWKS object served by AWS for your Cognito user pool. This JWKS object can be found in an endpoint [build from your AWS region and user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-tokens-verifying-a-jwt.html) in the format `https://cognito-idp.<Region>.amazonaws.com/<userPoolId>/.well-known/jwks.json`.

Pointing to a JWKS file ensures that token verification will work seamlessly even in the case that AWS rotates their encryption keys and that tokens signed with revoked keys will no longer be accepted by SurrealDB.

:::note
<em> Note: </em> Remote JWKS objects are locally cached by SurrealDB to prevent unnecessary network requests. Due to this, revoked keys may not become untrusted immediately. If you wish to immediately update the cache, you may delete the files under the <code>storage/jwks/</code> and <code>cache/jwks/</code> directories created in the directory from which you run SurrealDB.
:::

The following queries will create the required resources to authenticate a token for a scope:

```surql
-- Specify the namespace and database that will be used.
-- These values should match the custom claims that we configured before.
USE NS test DB test;            
                                        
-- Define the scope where the token will be used.
-- The name of the scope should match the custom claim that we configured before.
DEFINE SCOPE user;              
                                        
-- Define the public key to verify tokens issued by Auth0 for our application.
-- The name of the token should match the custom claim that we configured before.
DEFINE TOKEN cognito ON SCOPE user TYPE JWKS VALUE "https://cognito-idp.<YOUR_AWS_REGION>.amazonaws.com/<YOUR_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID>/.well-known/jwks.json";
```

In the example above, replace the placeholders with values applicable to your Cognito User Pool.

:::note
<em> Note: </em> In order to allow SurrealDB to establish a connection with AWS Cognito to download the JWKS object, you will require running it with the network <a href="/docs/security/capabilities">capability</a>. For the strongest security, provide your specific Auth0 domain when starting SurrealDB with <code>--allow-net</code>. For example: <code>--allow-net cognito-idp.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com</code>.
:::

### Defining authorization criteria in SurrealDB

For this simple example, we will create a single table named “user”, where any user that authenticates through AWS Cognito using your application with a verified email address will be able to register, view and update their data. For this to work as intended, we will need to verify some information in the token claims.

```surql
DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMAFULL            
  -- Authorized users can select, update, delete and create user records.
  -- Records that do not match the permissions will not be modified nor returned.
  PERMISSIONS FOR select, update, delete, create
  WHERE
    -- The token scope must match the scope that we defined.
    -- The name of the scope should match the scope that we defined before.
    $scope = "user"
    -- The issuer claim must match the URL of your AWS Cognito User Pool ID.
    AND $token.iss = "https://cognito-idp.<YOUR_AWS_REGION>.amazonaws.com/<YOUR_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID>"
    -- The audience claim must match you AWS Cognito Client ID.
    AND $token.aud = "<YOUR_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID>"
    -- The email claim must match the email of the user being queried.
    AND email = $token.email
    -- If you configure AWS Cognito to verify email addresses, you can check it.
    -- AND email_verified = true        
;

-- In this example, we will use the email as the primary identifier for a user.
DEFINE INDEX email ON user FIELDS email UNIQUE;
DEFINE FIELD email ON user TYPE string ASSERT string::is::email($value);
-- We define some other information present in the token that we want to store.
DEFINE FIELD cognito_username ON user TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD country ON user TYPE string;
;                                       
```

It is important to know that [validating the issuer and audience of the token is a requirement of AWS Cognito](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-tokens-verifying-a-jwt.html), other providers may require validating additional claims to ensure that the token is being used as intended.

It is also important to note that the `$auth` variable accessible from SurrealQL will not contain any values in this case, as it requires the `id` claim to be added to the JWT, containing the value of the identifier of a SurrealDB record. For the current example, the `$auth` variable will not be necessary.

## Creating a Simple Web Application

For this guide, we will create a simple client web application that will direct the user to log in with AWS Cognito, redirect the user back your our application with a query parameter containing an authentication code and exchange that code to Cognito for the user identity token which we will use to authenticate with SurrealDB. The application will create a SurrealDB user containing some data from the token claims. This user will later be able visit our web application and retrieve their information from SurrealDB.

:::note
<em> Note: </em> Warning about identity vs. access token.
:::

You can develop this application yourself following the [Cognito Developer Guide for authentication], the [Cognito SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/service_code_examples_cognito-identity-provider.html) or the new [Amplify SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-integrate-apps.html#cognito-integrate-apps-amplify).

Alternatively, we have developed an [example application](https://github.com/surrealdb/examples/tree/main/aws-cognito) that uses plain JavaScript to authenticate with Cognito using the first method. For the purposes of following this guide, we would recommend using our example code. However, keep in mind that this code aims to be as simple as possible and is not suitable for production applications.
