# LIVE SELECT

## `LIVE SELECT` statement

The `LIVE SELECT` statement can be used to initiate a real-time selection from a table, including the option to apply filters.

In practical terms, when you execute a `LIVE SELECT` query, it triggers an ongoing session that captures any subsequent changes to the data in real-time. These changes are then immediately transmitted to the client, ensuring that the client is consistently updated with the latest data modifications.

### Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
LIVE SELECT
	[
		[ VALUE ] @fields [ AS @alias ]
		| DIFF
	]
	FROM @targets
	[ WHERE @conditions ]
	[ FETCH @fields ... ]
;
```

## Example usage
### Basic usage

By default, SurrealDB will push the entire record over the websocket when created or updated, and just the record's ID when deleted.

```surql
LIVE SELECT * FROM person;
```

### Diff 

When using the `DIFF` mode, updates will be sent in the form of an array with [JSON Patch](https://jsonpatch.com/) messages.

```surql
LIVE SELECT DIFF FROM person;
```
### Filter the live query

You can optionally apply filters with the `WHERE` clause.

```surql
LIVE SELECT * FROM person WHERE age > 18;
```
