# Strings 

## Strings 

Strings can be used to store text values. All text fields can include unicode values, emojis, and tabular and multine breaks.

```sql
CREATE person SET text = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet';
```

Strings can be created using single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

```sql
CREATE person SET text = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet";
```

Any string in SurrealDB can include unicode text.

```sql
CREATE person SET text = "I ❤️ SurrealDB";
```

Strings can also include line breaks.

```sql
CREATE person SET text = "This
is
over
multiple
lines";
```
