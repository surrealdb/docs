SurrealDB makes building and scaling realtime apps dramatically quicker and easier. Get started by [installing the server](/docs/category/installation/), and jump into our [getting started guide](/docs/category/introduction/) to learn how to insert and query data in SurrealDB in minutes.

To quickly test out SurrealDB and [SurrealQL](/docs/category/surrealql/) functionality, we've included [demo dataset](/docs/category/surrealql/demo) which you can download and [<code>import</code> ](/docs/category/surrealql/)into your SurrealDB instance.

The current version of ![SurrealDB-text](./../static/img/surrealdb-heading.svg "SurrealDB")  is v1.0.0
