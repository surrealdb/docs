# Overview

<h1> SurrealDB Documentation</h1>

SurrealDB makes building and scaling realtime apps dramatically quicker and easier. Get started by [installing the server](/docs/installation/overview), and jump into our [getting started guide](/docs/introduction/start) to learn how to insert and query data in SurrealDB in minutes.

To quickly test out SurrealDB and [SurrealQL](/docs/surrealql/overview) functionality, we've included [demo dataset](/docs/surrealql/demo) which you can download and [<code>import</code> ](/docs/cli/import)into your SurrealDB instance.

<span>The current version of SurrealDB </span><span> is v1.0.0</span>
