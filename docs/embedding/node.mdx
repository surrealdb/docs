# Embedding in Node.js

## Embedding in Node.js

SurrealDB is designed to be run in many different ways, and environments. Due to the [separation of the storage and compute](/docs/introduction/architecture) layers, SurrealDB can be run in embedded mode, from within a number of different language environments. In Node.js, SurrealDB can be run as an in-memory database, or it can persist data using a file-based storage engine. The documentation for embedding SurrealDB within Node.js has not yet been released. In the meantime, please refer to the [Node.js](/docs/integration/sdks/nodejs) client SDK documentation to get started with connecting to SurrealDB from Node.js.
