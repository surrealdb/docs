# Embedding in Javascript

## Embedding in Javascript

SurrealDB is designed to be run in many different ways, and environments. Due to the [separation of the storage and compute](/docs/introduction/architecture) layers, SurrealDB can be run in embedded mode, from within a number of different language environments. In JavaScript, SurrealDB can be run as an in-memory database, or it can persist data using IndexedDB in the browser. 

The documentation for embedding SurrealDB within JavaScript has not yet been released. In the meantime, please refer to the [JavaScript client SDK](/docs/integration/sdks/javascript) documentation to get started with connecting to SurrealDB from JavaScript.
