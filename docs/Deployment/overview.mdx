# Overview

## Deployment

Getting started with SurrealDB is intended to be quick and easy. All of SurrealDB's functionality for starting a server, and importing and exporting data, is enabled through the command-line tool, packaged and distributed as a single executable file, which can be downloaded, installed, or run from within Docker.
