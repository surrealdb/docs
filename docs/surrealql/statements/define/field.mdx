# DEFINE FIELD

# `DEFINE FIELD` statement

The `DEFINE FIELD` statement allows you to instantiate a named field on a table, enabling you to set the field's data type, set a default value, apply assertions to protect data consistency, and set permissions specifying what operations can be performed on the field.

## Requirements
- You must be authenticated as a root or namespace user before you can use the `DEFINE FIELD` statement.
- [You must select your namespace and database](/docs/surrealql/statements/use) before you can use the `DEFINE FIELD` statement.

## Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
DEFINE FIELD @name ON [ TABLE ] @table
	[ [ FLEXIBLE ] TYPE @type ]
	[ DEFAULT @expression ]
	[ VALUE @expression ]
	[ ASSERT @expression ]
	[ PERMISSIONS [ NONE | FULL
		| FOR select @expression
		| FOR create @expression
		| FOR update @expression
		| FOR delete @expression
	] ]
```

## Example usage 

The following expression shows the simplest way to use the `DEFINE FIELD` statement.

```surql
-- Declare the name of a field.
DEFINE FIELD email ON TABLE user;
```
## Defining data types

The `DEFINE FIELD` statement allows you to set the data type of a field. For a full list of supported data types, see [Data types](/docs/surrealql/datamodel/overview).

### Simple data types
```surql
-- Set a field to have the string data type
DEFINE FIELD email ON TABLE user TYPE string;

-- Set a field to have the datetime data type
DEFINE FIELD created ON TABLE user TYPE datetime;

-- Set a field to have the bool data type
DEFINE FIELD locked ON TABLE user TYPE bool;

-- Set a field to have the number data type
DEFINE FIELD login_attempts ON TABLE user TYPE number;
```

### Flexible data types

Flexible types allow you to have `SCHEMALESS` functionality on a `SCHEMAFULL` table. This is especially useful for working with nested objects.

```surql
DEFINE FIELD metadata ON TABLE user FLEXIBLE TYPE object;
```

### Array type 
```surql
-- Set a field to have the array data type
DEFINE FIELD roles ON TABLE user TYPE array<string>;
-- Set the contents of the array to only support a string data type
DEFINE FIELD roles.* ON TABLE user TYPE string;

-- Set a field to have the array data type
DEFINE FIELD posts ON TABLE user TYPE array;
-- Set the contents of the array to only support a record data type
DEFINE FIELD posts.* ON TABLE user TYPE record<string>;
```
### Option type

```surql
-- A user may enter a biography, but it is not required.
-- By using the option type, you also allow for NONE values.
DEFINE FIELD biography ON TABLE user TYPE option<string>;
```

## Setting a default value

```surql
-- A user is not locked by default.
DEFINE FIELD locked ON TABLE user TYPE bool
-- Set a default value if empty
DEFAULT false;
```

## Readonly field

One common pattern is to have a field that is set once and never changed.
This can be achieved by setting the latest `VALUE` of a field to `$before`, a.k.a. the same value as before.

```surql
-- Once a value is set for this field, it will never change
DEFINE FIELD created ON TABLE user TYPE datetime
  VALUE $before OR $value;
```

## Alter a passed value

```surql
-- Ensure that an email address is always stored in lowercase characters
DEFINE FIELD email ON TABLE user TYPE string
  VALUE string::lowercase($value);
```

## Asserting rules on fields

You can take your field definitions even further by using asserts. Assert is a powerful feature that can be used to ensure that your data remains consistent.

### Email is required

```surql
-- Give the user table an email field. Store it in a string
DEFINE FIELD email ON TABLE user TYPE string
  -- Check if the value is a properly formatted email address
  ASSERT string::is::email($value);
```

### Array with allowed values

By using an Access Control List as an example we can show how we can restrict what values can be stored in an array.

```surql
-- An ACL can be applied to any kind of resource (record)
DEFINE FIELD resource ON TABLE acl TYPE record;
-- We associate the acl with a user using record<user>
DEFINE FIELD user ON TABLE acl TYPE record<user>;

-- The permissions for the user+resource will be stored in an array.
DEFINE FIELD permissions ON TABLE acl TYPE array
  -- The array must not be empty because at least one permission is required to make a valid ACL
  ASSERT array::len($value) > 0;

-- Assigned permissions are identified by specific string values.
DEFINE FIELD permissions.* ON TABLE acl TYPE string
  -- Allow only these values in the array
  ASSERT $value INSIDE ["create", "read", "write", "delete"];

-- SEE IT IN ACTION
-- 1: Add users
CREATE user:tobie SET firstName = 'Tobie', lastName = 'Hitchcock',
  email = 'Tobie.Hitchcock@surrealdb.com';
CREATE user:abc SET firstName = 'A', lastName = 'B',
  email = 'c@d.com';
CREATE user:efg SET firstName = 'E', lastName = 'F',
  email = 'g@h.com';

-- 2: Create a resource
CREATE document:SurrealDB_whitepaper SET
  name = "some messaging queue";

-- 3: Associate with ACL
CREATE acl SET user = user:tobie, resource = document:SurrealDB_whitepaper, permissions = ["create", "write", "read"];
CREATE acl SET user = user:abc, resource = document:SurrealDB_whitepaper, permissions = ["read", "delete"];

-- Test Asserts using failure examples
-- A: Create ACL without permissions field
CREATE acl SET
  user = user:efg,
  permissions = [], # FAIL - permissions must not be empty
  resource = document:SurrealDB_whitepaper;
-- B: Create acl with invalid permisson
CREATE acl SET
  user = user:efg,
  permissions = ["all"], # FAIL - This value is not allowed in the array
  resource = document:SurrealDB_whitepaper;
```

### Using RegEX to validate a string

```surql
-- Specify a field on the user table
DEFINE FIELD countrycode ON user TYPE string
	-- Ensure country code is ISO-3166
	ASSERT $value = /[A-Z]{3}/
	-- Set a default value if empty
	VALUE $value OR $before OR 'GBR'
;
```
