# DEFINE USER

# `DEFINE USER` statement

Use the `DEFINE USER` statement to create system users on SurrealDB

:::note 
<em>NOTE: </em> While existing logins still function, the DEFINE LOGIN statement has been replaced with DEFINE USER.
:::



## Requirements

- You must be authenticated with a user that has enough permissions. Only the OWNER built-in role grants permissions to create users.
- You must be authenticated with a user that has permissions on the level where you are creating the user:
    - Root users can create Root, Namespace and Database users.
    - Namespace users can create Namespace and Database users
    - Database user can create Database users.
- To select the level where you want to create the user, [you may need to select a namespace and/or database](/docs/surrealql/statements/use) before you can use the `DEFINE USER` statement for database or namespace tokens.

:::note 
<em>NOTE: </em> You cannot use the DEFINE USER statement to create a SCOPE user.

## Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
DEFINE USER @name ON [ NAMESPACE | DATABASE | SCOPE @scope ] TYPE @type VALUE @value
```

## Example usuage 
The following example shows how you can create a `ROOT` user using the `DEFINE USER` statement.

```surql
-- Create a root user
DEFINE USER username ON ROOT PASSWORD '123456' ROLES OWNER;
```
The following example shows how you can create a `NAMESPACE` user using the `DEFINE USER` statement.

```surql
-- Specify the namespace
USE NS abcum;
-- Create the user
DEFINE USER username ON NAMESPACE PASSWORD '123456' ROLES OWNER;
```

The following example shows how you can create a `DATABASE` user using the `DEFINE USER` statement.
```surql
-- Specify the namespace and database for the user
USE NS abcum DB app_vitalsense;
-- Create the user
DEFINE USER username ON DATABASE PASSWORD '123456' ROLES OWNER;
```

## Roles
Currently, only the built-in roles OWNER, EDITOR and VIEWER are available.
