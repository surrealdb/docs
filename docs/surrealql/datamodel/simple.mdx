# Basic types 

## Basic types

SurrealDB has a large number of simple built-in types. With an advanced type system, SurrealDB enables advanced storage, simplified comparison, complex data structures, and mathematical operations directly within the database.

## None values
Values can be specifically set to `NONE` in SurrealDB to remove a field from a record.

```surql
CREATE person SET children = NONE;
```
The `NONE` keyword can be written in anycase.

```surql 
CREATE person SET children = NONE, siblings = none;
```

## Null values
Values can be specifically set to `NULL` in SurrealDB to denote a field which is set, but which does not have a value.

```surql
CREATE person SET children = NULL;
```
The `NULL` keyword can be written in anycase.

```surql
CREATE person SET children = NULL, siblings = null;
```

## Booleans
Boolean values can be used to mark whether a field is `true` or `false`.

```surql
CREATE person SET newsletter = false, interested = true;
```

Boolean values can be written in anycase.

```surql
CREATE person SET newsletter = FALSE, interested = True;
```
