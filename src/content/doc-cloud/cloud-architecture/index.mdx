# Cloud architecture

Surreal Cloud benefits from [SurrealDBâ€™s layered architecture](/docs/surrealdb/introduction/architecture), which separates storage from compute. Surreal Cloud storage is backed by object storage (e.g. Amazon S3), enabling from improved scalability, durability and availability.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the future, we plan to offer an option to launch multiple instances against a centralised storage layer together with autoscaling. These features will allow customers to, for example, have one production instance autoscaling running 24x7 for the main transactional part of the application and have different data & analytics teams querying the same centralised storage layer with their own individual compute needs (e.g. higher memory or GPU) meaning they can run only when needed for the specific query.

This will greatly reduce efforts to extract and replicate data into a separate analytical storage environment, without affecting database performance and controlling for cost.
