# Configure an Instance

You can configure your Instance in the Surreal Cloud dashboard by clicking on the **Configure** button on the Instance card.

src={{
	light: LightConfigure,
	dark: DarkConfigure,
	}}  
/>

## Configuration options

From the **Configure** modal, you can change the following settings:

- **Instance type**: the type of the Instance.
- **Compute nodes**: the number of compute nodes to use.
- **Capabilities**: the capabilities of the Instance.

You can also access the Instance hostname and delete the Instance from this modal.

### Instance type

The Instance type you choose will determine the compute and memory available to your Instance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can only change the type of the Instance on a paid plan. Please add billing information to your account before changing the Instance type.

### Compute nodes

> [!NOTE]
> In beta, you can only have 1 compute node. Customising compute nodes will be available soon.

The number of compute nodes you choose will determine the number of Instances you can run on the same plan. For example, if you choose 2 compute nodes, you can run 2 Instances on the same plan.

### Instance capabilities

The capabilities you choose will determine the features available to your Instance. This includes scripting, guest access, enabled endpoints for RPC and HTTP and more.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In beta, these Instance capabilities are read-only.

### Delete an Instance 

You can delete an Instance by clicking the **Delete** button on the Instance card. This will bring up a confirmation modal. Once confirmed, the Instance will be deleted and you will be redirected to the Instances page.
