## Configuration options

From the **Configure** modal, you can change the following settings:

- **Instance type**: The type of the instance.
- **Compute nodes**: The number of compute nodes to use.
- **Capabilities**: The capabilities of the instance.

You can also access the instance hostname and delete the instance from this modal.

### Instance type

The instance type you choose will determine the compute and memory available to your instance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can only change the type of the instance on a paid plan. Please add billing information to your account before changing the instance type.

- **free**: this configuration has 0.25 vCPUs, 512 MB of memory 
- **small**: this configuration has 0.5 vCPUs, 1 GB of memory 
- **medium**: this configuration has 1 vCPU, 2 GB of memory 
- **large**: this configuration has 2 vCPUs, 4 GB of memory 
- **xlarge**: this configuration has 4 vCPUs, 4 GB of memory 
- **2xlarge**: this configuration is suitable for applications with very high traffic. It has 8 vCPUs, 8 GB of memory.
- **4xlarge**: this configuration is suitable for applications with very high traffic. It has 16 vCPUs, 64 GB of memory.


### Compute nodes

> [!NOTE]
> In beta, you can only have 1 compute node. Customising compute nodes will be available soon.

The number of compute nodes you choose will determine the number of instances you can run on the same plan. For example, if you choose 2 compute nodes, you can run 2 instances on the same plan.

### Instance capabilities

The capabilities you choose will determine the features available to your instance. This includes scripting, guest access, enabled endpoints for RPC and HTTP and more.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In beta, these instance capabilities are read-only.
