# Migrating data from SurrealDB to Surreal Cloud

Surreal Cloud is a hosted version of SurrealDB, providing a fully managed, scalable, and secure database solution. This guide will help you migrate your existing SurrealDB instance to Surreal Cloud.


## Exporting and importing data

1. Export your current data as SQL. You can do this using the [`surreal export`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/export) command in the terminal:

```bash
# Example export command to export data to a file called `export.surql` in the downloads directory.
surreal export --conn <connection-url> --user root --pass root --ns test --db test downloads/export.surql
``` 

2. This will create a file called `export.surql` in the current directory.

3. You can now import this file into your surreal cloud instance.


```bash
surreal import --conn <connection-url> --user root --pass root --ns test --db test downloads/export.surql
```
