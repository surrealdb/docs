## Security

### How secure is Surreal Cloud?

Surreal Cloud is designed with security in mind and aims to provide robust protection for your data and applications. The platform leverages industry-standard security practices, including encryption at rest and in transit, network isolation, access controls and monitoring. For authentication, Surreal Cloud supports multi-factor authentication through the available identity providers that offer it to their users. We are also working towards ISO 27001 and SOC 2 compliance, with plans to expand to other industry-specific compliance programs in the future, such as HIPAA or PCI DSS.

Additionally, Surreal Cloud is built on top of SurrealDB, which provides powerful and flexible [security features](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/security/summary#product) that are available to all Surreal Cloud customers. SurrealDB is developed and maintained following modern [security practices](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/security/summary#process) to ensure early detection of security vulnerabilities and other security issues.

Please note that we will keep improving security during the ongoing beta stage and, as a precaution, we recommend abstaining from hosting sensitive data in Surreal Cloud during this stage.
