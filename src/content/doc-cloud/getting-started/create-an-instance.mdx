# Create an Instance

Surreal Cloud allows you to create a new instance with a few clicks. You can create an instance in your personal account or in an organization. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Beta, you can create instances only in a personal account. Support for creating instances in organizations is coming soon.

You can create an instance in these steps from your Cloud dashboard:

1. Click on the **Create Instance** button.
    - You can choose to create a new instance either in your personal account or in an organization.
    - If you choose to create an instance in an organization, you need to select the organization from the dropdown list.

2. Input your instance details.
    - **Instance name**: the name of the instance.
    - **Instance version**: the version of SurrealDB you want to use. In the Beta release, only version `>v2.0.0` is available to use as it is the latest stable release. 

3. Select a region where you want to deploy your instance.
    - AWS Europe (Ireland)
    - AWS US East (N. Virginia)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The region you choose will affect your application's latency. For optimal performance, choose a region that is closest to your users.


4. Select an instance category: Instance category defines the resources allocated to your cloud instance. The Instance categories are in three different categories, **Development**, **Production**, and **Free Tier**. You can choose between the following configurations:

> [!NOTE]
> To use a Production or Development instance, you need to enter your billing and payment information.

- **Production**: For production environments, data at scale, or professional use cases.
    {/* - **large**: this configuration has 1 vCPU, 4096 MB of memory and a 40GB storage limit.
    - **xlarge**: this configuration has 2 vCPUs, 8192 MB of memory and a 80GB storage limit.
    - **2xlarge**: this configuration is suitable for applications with very high traffic. It has 4 vCPUs, 16384 MB of memory and a 160GB storage limit. */}

- **Development**: For testing, starter projects, or for low-traffic applications. Clusters under heavy load may experience CPU throttling.

    {/* - **tiny**: this configuration has 0.128 vCPUs, 256 MB of memory and a 10GB storage limit.
    - **small**: this configuration has 0.256 vCPUs, 512 MB of memory and a 10GB storage limit.
    - **medium**: this configuration has 0.512 vCPUs, 1024 MB of memory and a 20GB storage limit. */}

- **Free Tier**: Experience SurrealDB with a free instance.
    {/* - **tiny**: this configuration has 0.128 vCPUs, 256 MB of memory and a 10GB storage limit. */}

5. Choose nodes: the number of nodes selected will define the number of compute nodes allocated to your Instance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The number of nodes you choose will affect the cost of your Instance.

6. After customising your Instance, click the **Create** button. You will see a confirmation message with the details of your Instance. You can now connect to your Instance using your [preferred connection method](/docs/cloud/connect/).


## Next steps

Now that you have created an instance, you can [connect to your Surreal Cloud Instance](/docs/cloud/connect/).
