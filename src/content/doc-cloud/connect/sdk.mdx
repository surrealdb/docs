# Connect via SDK

Once you have created a Surreal Cloud Instance, you can connect to it using any of the [available SDKs](/docs/surrealdb/integration/sdks). This allows you to interact with your Surreal Cloud Instance programmatically.


<Image

src={{
	light: OpenInSDK,
	dark: OpenInSDK,
	}}
/>
 
After you have selected your SDK, you will need to provide your connection details which will populate the code snippet to your Surreal Cloud Instance.


## Enter connection details

When using any of the SurrealDB SDKs, before you can start querying your Surreal Cloud Instance, you will need to provide your connection details. SurrealDB requires **namespace** & **database** details so that it knows where to run and store your data. Learn more about [namespaces](/docs/surrealdb/introduction/concepts/namespace) and [databases](/docs/surrealdb/introduction/concepts/database) in the SurrealDB documentation.



### Create a root authentication

> [!NOTE]
> This step is only required if you are authenticating using the `signin` method on your initial connection. Learn more about [access methods](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/access) and [system Users](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/user) in the SurrealDB documentation.


First navigate to the Authentication panel of Surrealist. There, you can create a root user by clicking on the **+** button in the **Root Authentication** section. 

In the dialog that appears, select either:

- **new system user**: create a root user by entering a username, password, and selecting a role to define their access level to Instance resources and permissions
- **new access method**: create an access method by entering a name and selecting the type to define its access level to Instance resources and permissions

For both options, you can configure the Token duration and session duration.

src={{
	light: CreateRootUser,
	dark: CreateRootUser,
	}}
/>

After creating your root authentication, you will be able to authenticate with your Surreal Cloud Instance using any of the available SDKs.

If you want to create a Namespace and Database authentication for record-level access, you will need to first create a Namespace and Database. Learn more about [namespaces](/docs/surrealdb/introduction/concepts/namespace) and [databases](/docs/surrealdb/introduction/concepts/database) in the SurrealDB documentation.


## Connect to your Surreal Cloud Instance

After you have created your root authentication for root-level access, you can use the credentials to sign in to your Surreal Cloud Instance. 

The `connect` method takes your Surreal Cloud connection string as an argument to connect to your Surreal Cloud Instance. You can then fill in the **namespace** and **database** details to select the specific namespace and database you want to use. 

If you are using a system user option of the root authentication, you can also fill in the **username** and **password** details to sign in to your Surreal Cloud Instance.

> [!NOTE]
>If you are using a non-root user, depending on the access method you have created, you will need to fill in the `access` details to sign in to your Surreal Cloud Instance. Please refer to the [documentation for your specific SDK](/docs/surrealdb/integration/sdks) for more information.


{/* Surreal Cloud provides a connection string that you can use to connect to your instance. This connection string includes the endpoint and token that you need to authenticate your connection. 

In your preferred SDK, using the `connect` method, which takes a connection string as an argument to connect to your Surreal Cloud Instance.  */}



Below are examples of how you can connect to your Instance using the SurrealDB SDK:
