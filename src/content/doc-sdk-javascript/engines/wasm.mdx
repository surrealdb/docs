# WebAssembly (Wasm)

WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

The SurrealDB Wasm engine is a plugin for the SurrealDB JavaScript SDK, which can be used to run SurrealDB as an embedded database within browser environments. Using this engine enables SurrealDB to be run in-memory, or to persist data by running on top of IndexedDB. 

It allows for a consistent JavaScript and TypeScript API when using this SDK by adding support for embedded storage engines (memory, indxdb) alongside the remote connection protocols (http, https, ws, wss).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This library works with ES modules (import), not CommonJS (require) and is available on NPM as [`@surrealdb/wasm`](https://npmjs.com/package/@surrealdb/wasm). It requires the [JavaScript SDK](https://npmjs.com/package/surrealdb) to operate.

## Installation

Before installing the Wasm engine, you need to install the JavaScript SDK using the instructions in the [installation](/docs/sdk/javascript/installation) documentation. 

After installing the SDK, install the Wasm engine using the following command:

```bash title="Install"
npm install @surrealdb/wasm
```


## Configuration

To use the Wasm engine, you need to import the `surrealdbWasmEngines` function from the `@surrealdb/wasm` package, and pass it as an option to the `Surreal` constructor.

```js
import { Surreal } from 'surrealdb';
import { surrealdbWasmEngines } from '@surrealdb/wasm';
```

After importing the `surrealdbWasmEngines` function, you can pass it as an option to the `Surreal` constructor. 

```js
const db = new Surreal({
    engines: surrealdbWasmEngines(),
});
```

If you are using a bundler like Vite, Webpack, or Parcel, you can import the `surrealdbWasmEngines` function directly. For example, using Vite, place the following in your `vite.config.js` file:

```js title="vite.config.js"
optimizeDeps: {
    exclude: ["@surrealdb/wasm"],
    esbuildOptions: {
        target: "esnext",
    },
},
esbuild: {
    supported: {
        "top-level-await": true
    },
}
```

## Connecting 

Using the [`.connect()`](https://surrealdb.com/docs/sdk/javascript/methods/connect) method, you can connect to a SurrealDB instance. The connection string specifies whether to connect to the Wasm engine, in memory or persisted with the `mem://` or `indxdb://` prefixes respectively.

### Connection Example

```js title="index.js"
import { Surreal } from 'surrealdb';
import { surrealdbWasmEngines } from '@surrealdb/wasm';

// Enable the WebAssembly engines
const db = new Surreal({
    engines: surrealdbWasmEngines(),
});

// Now we can start SurrealDB as an in-memory database

await db.connect("mem://");

// Or we can start a persisted IndexedDB database

await db.connect("indxdb://demo");

// Now use the JavaScript SDK as normal.
```

## Next steps

After setting up the Wasm engine, you can continue with the rest of the [SDK documentation](/docs/sdk/javascript/core). You can refer to the [methods](/docs/sdk/javascript/methods) documentation for more information on using SurrealDB with the Wasm engine also see the [Data types](/docs/sdk/javascript/data-types) documentation for more information on how to use the data types supported by SurrealDB.
