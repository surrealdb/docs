# Create a new connection

After [installing the SDK](/docs/sdk/dotnet/installation), you can initialize a new instance of a SurrealDB client.
When creating a new connection to a SurrealDB instance, you can choose to connect to a local or remote endpoint.

```csharp
using SurrealDb.Net;

using var db = new SurrealDbClient("ws://127.0.0.1:8000/rpc");

await db.Connect();
await db.Use("test", "test");
```

From the code snippet above, you can see that the .NET SDK has a couple of methods that you can use to initialize a new project with SurrealDB. 

## `SurrealDbClient`

Creates a new client, detecting the right protocol from the provided endpoint.

```csharp title="Method Syntax"
new SurrealDbClient(endpoint)
```

### Connection options

You can specify your connection protocol either as `http`, `https`, `ws`, or `wss`.
Since SurrealDB also supports RPC over WebSocket, by default, it is specified with a `/rpc` suffix. 

<Tabs groupId="connection-options">
  <TabItem value="local" label="Local endpoint" default>

```csharp
// Creates a new client using a local endpoint
using var db = new SurrealDbClient("http://127.0.0.1:8000");
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="remote" label="Remote endpoint">

```csharp
// Creates a new client using a remote endpoint
using var db = new SurrealDbClient("wss://cloud.surrealdb.com/rpc");
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ns-db" label="Namespace and database">

```csharp
var options = new SurrealDbOptions
{
    Endpoint = "wss://cloud.surrealdb.com/rpc",
    Namespace = "surrealdb",
    Database = "docs",
};

// Specify a namespace and database pair to use
using var db = new SurrealDbClient(options);
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="token" label="Token">

```csharp
var options = new SurrealDbOptions
{
    Endpoint = "wss://cloud.surrealdb.com/rpc",
    Token = "......",
};

// Authenticate with an existing token
using var db = new SurrealDbClient(options);
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="credentials" label="Credentials">

```csharp
var options = new SurrealDbOptions
{
    Endpoint = "wss://cloud.surrealdb.com/rpc",
    Username = "root",
    Password = "surrealdb",
};

// Authenticate using a pair of credentials
using var db = new SurrealDbClient(options);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

> [!NOTE]
> Having to manually set all these options into a `SurrealDbOptions` object can be cumbersome.
> If you are familiar with the concept of Connection Strings, you can simply pass a connection string to the `SurrealDbClient` constructor.
> See the [Connection Strings](/docs/sdk/dotnet/core/connection-strings) section for more information.

### Effect of connection protocol on token & session duration

The connection protocol you choose affects how authentication tokens and sessions work:

With websockets connections (`ws://`, `wss://`) you open a single long-lived stateful connection where after the initial authentication, the session duration applies and if not specified, defaults to `NONE` meaning that the session never expires unless otherwise specified. 

When you connect with a HTTP connection (`http://`, `https://`), every request you make is short-lived and stateless, requiring you to authenticate every request individually for which the token is used, creating a short lived session. Hence, the token duration which defaults to 1 hour applies.

You can extend the session duration of a token or a session by setting the `DURATION` clause when creating a new access method with the [`DEFINE ACCESS METHOD`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/access) statement or when defining a new user with the [`DEFINE USER`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/user) statement. 

Learn more about token and session duration in our [security best practices](/docs/surrealdb/reference-guide/security-best-practices#expiration) documentation.

## `.Connect()` {#connect}

The `.Connect()` executes a connection attempt to the underlying endpoint using the provided connection options.

> [!NOTE]
>This method is automatically called before executing any other call to the SurrealDB instance.
>It means that you do not have to explicitely call this method.
>Just note that in some contexts, calling this method before hand can improve performance by avoiding cold starts.

### Example usage

```csharp
await db.Connect();
```

<br />

## `.Use()` {#use}

Depending on the complexity of your use case, you can switch to a specific namespace and database using the `.Use()` method.
This is particularly useful if you want to switch to a different setup after connecting.

Learn more about the `.Use()` method [in the methods section](/docs/sdk/dotnet/methods/use).

### Example usage

```csharp
await db.Use("test", "test");
```
