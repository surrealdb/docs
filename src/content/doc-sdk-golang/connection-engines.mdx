# Connection Engines

There are two different connection engines you can use to connect to SurrealDb backend. You can do so via Websocket or through HTTP
connections

### Via Websocket
```go
db, err := surrealdb.New("ws://localhost:8000")
```
or for a secure connection
```go
db, err := surrealdb.New("wss://localhost:8000")
```

### Via HTTP
There are some functions that are not available on RPC when using HTTP but on Websocket. All these except
the "live" endpoint are effectively implemented in the HTTP library and provides the same result as though
it is natively available on HTTP. While using the HTTP connection engine, note that live queries will still
use a websocket connection if the backend supports it
```go
db, err := surrealdb.New("http://localhost:8000")
```
or for a secure connection
```go
db, err := surrealdb.New("https://localhost:8000")
```
