# Java SDK

The SurrealDB SDK for Java is the primary SDK for interacting with SurrealDB from client or server-side applications, systems, and APIs. You can use the Java SDK to interact with your SurrealDB database instances, or to run SurrealDB as an embedded database within your Java application, with functionality for executing queries, managing data, running database functions, authenticating to the database, building user signup and authentication functionality, and subscribing to data changes with live queries. When connecting to remote database instances, connections automatically reconnect when terminated.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The SDK requires Java JDK version `8` or greater, and is available as a [Maven package](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.surrealdb/surrealdb).

> [!NOTE]
> The SDK works seamlessly with SurrealDB versions `v2.0.0` to <Version />, ensuring compatibility with the latest version.

> [!WARNING]
> This API is not yet fully stabilized and may be subject to change until the SDK reaches `1.0.0`.
