# Embedding in Javascript

SurrealDB is designed to be run in many different ways, and environments. Due to the [separation of the storage and compute](/docs/surrealdb/introduction/architecture) layers, SurrealDB can be run in embedded mode, from within a number of different language environments. In JavaScript, SurrealDB can be run as an in-memory database, or it can persist data using IndexedDB in the browser.


The way to embed SurrealDB in JavaScript depends on the environment you are running in. For browser environments, you can use the [Wasm engine](/docs/sdk/javascript/engines/wasm) to run SurrealDB in-memory or with IndexedDB persistence. For Node.js, you can use the [Node.js engine](/docs/sdk/javascript/engines/nodejs) to run SurrealDB as an embedded database. 

## Browser
In browser environments, you can use the [Wasm engine](/docs/sdk/javascript/engines/wasm) to run SurrealDB in-memory or with IndexedDB persistence

## Server

In server environments, you can use the [Node.js engine](/docs/sdk/javascript/engines/nodejs) to run SurrealDB as an embedded database.
