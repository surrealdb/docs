SurrealDB makes building and scaling realtime apps dramatically quicker and easier. Get started by [installing the server](/docs/surrealdb/installation), and jump into our [getting started guide](/docs/surrealdb/introduction/start) to learn how to insert and query data in SurrealDB in minutes.

To quickly test out SurrealDB and [SurrealQL](/docs/surrealql) functionality, we've included [demo dataset](/docs/surrealql/demo) which you can download and [<code>import</code> ](/docs/surrealdb/cli/import)into your SurrealDB instance.

<span>The current stable version of SurrealDB </span><span> is <a href='https://surrealdb.com/releases'> <Version /> </a></span>
