SurrealDB is a [Multi-Model Database](/features/multi-model-database) that allows you to store and manage date in relational, document, graph, time-series, vector & search and key-value models in one place. 

Unified by a powerful SQL like query language [SurrealQL](/docs/surrealql), you can query SurrealDB in ways that are familiar to you, but with the power of a modern database. In addition, SurrealDB is designed to be [distributed](/docs/surrealdb/introduction/architecture) and [scalable](/docs/surrealdb/introduction/architecture), allowing you to build and scale your applications with ease.

Also providing additional query methods like [GraphQL](/docs/surrealdb/querying/graphql), [HTTP](/docs/surrealdb/integration/http) and [RPC](/docs/surrealdb/integration/rpc), you can also query SurrealDB in your native environments using [SDKs](/docs/surrealdb/integration/sdks), we support [JavaScript](/docs/sdk/javascript), [Python](/docs/sdk/python), [Go](/docs/sdk/golang), [Rust](/docs/sdk/rust), [Java](/docs/sdk/java) and [.Net](/docs/sdk/dotnet).

We've included a [demo dataset](/docs/surrealql/demo) which you can download and [<code>import</code> ](/docs/surrealdb/cli/import)into your SurrealDB instance.



SurrealDB supports all [realeased versions](/releases) from `1.0.0` onwards. <span>The current stable version of SurrealDB </span><span> is <a href='/releases'> <Version /> </a></span>
