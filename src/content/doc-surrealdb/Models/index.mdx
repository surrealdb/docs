# Multi-model

When you think of a database, you probably think of a table. A table is a collection of rows and columns, where each row represents a record and each column represents a field. In a relational database, these tables are connected by foreign keys, which are columns that reference the primary key of another table.

SurrealDB is a multi-model database, which means that it can store data in different formats. This flexibility allows you to choose the most appropriate data model for your use case, whether you are storing [graph](/docs/surrealdb/models/graph), [document](/docs/surrealdb/models/document), [time-series](/docs/surrealdb/models/sql), or [key-value](/docs/surrealdb/cli/start#surrealkv-beta) data.

Throughout this section, you will explore the different data models that SurrealDB supports and how they can be achieved using SurrealQL. You will also learn about how to think in SurrealDB wether you are a SQL, NoSQL, or graph developer.
