# Using SurrealDB as a Full Text Search Database

A full-text search database is designed to index and retrieve text-based data (like articles, messages, or comments) based on the meaning and structure of the text itself, rather than exact, literal matches. This allows you to:

Find documents containing certain keywords.
Search for phrases or words with variants (e.g., “run,” “runs,” “running”).
Rank results by relevance, not just by literal string matches.
Traditional relational databases have some limited text search capabilities (with varying degrees of support for text indexes), but more specialized systems—like Elasticsearch or Lucene-based solutions—excel at performing complex, scalable full-text queries.

However, new multi-model databases, including SurrealDB, are developing integrated full-text search capabilities so that you can store your data (as documents, graphs, or tables) and query it with advanced text search features. This guide will explain how to “think” in a full-text search model and show how SurrealDB helps you implement these concepts seamlessly.

## Core Concepts of Full-Text Search

### Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of splitting text into meaningful units (tokens). For instance, the sentence “Hello world!” may get tokenized into [ "hello", "world" ]. In more complex scenarios, tokenizers handle punctuation, compound words, or multiple languages.

### Stemming or Lemmatization
Many text search engines use stemming (e.g., turning “running” or “ran” into “run”) or lemmatization (which is more linguistically aware) to reduce words to their base form, improving match flexibility.

### Stop-Words
Common words (like “the,” “is,” “at,” “which,” etc.) may be deemed stop-words and removed from the index to reduce noise and index size.

### Inverted Index
Unlike typical B-trees or hash indexes, inverted indexes map tokens to the documents they appear in. For example:

```
"hello" -> [doc1, doc7, doc10]
"world" -> [doc1, doc5, doc7]
```

This structure enables fast lookups: if you query “hello world,” the engine instantly sees which documents contain these tokens and combines the results.

### Relevance Scoring
Most full-text search systems implement a scoring algorithm (like TF-IDF or BM25) that ranks results based on token frequency, rarity, field importance, etc. This ensures that documents with more frequent matching terms (and fewer extraneous words) rank higher.
