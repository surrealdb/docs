# Installation

One of the most popular ways to get started with SurrealDB is to install and run it as a standalone database service, allowing any number of clients to connect to it and interact with the data.

Whether you are installing SurrealDB on your local machine for development purposes, or spinning up a production database, this section will guide you through the installation process, ensuring that you have all the necessary dependencies and configurations in place to start using SurrealDB effectively.

While the current stable version of SurrealDB is <a href='/releases'> <Version /> </a>, we currently support all [realeased versions](/releases) from `1.0.0` onwards.

## Installation Steps

There are multiple ways to install SurrealDB, depending on your operating system and development environment. In this section, we will outline the installation steps for each operating system and development environment, ensuring that you have all the necessary dependencies and configurations in place to start using SurrealDB effectively.

You can install SurrealDB on the following operating systems:
