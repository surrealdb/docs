# Upgrading to `2.0.0` 

The `2.0.0` release of SurrealDB includes [many new features, improvements, and bug fixes](https://surrealdb.com/releases#v2-0-0). However, because of changes in the underlying way that SurrealDB stores data, three steps are required to migrate to `2.0.0`. 

We've listed them below, and we advise following this migration guide whether or not you encounter this issue!

## Issues

- A change in the underlying way data is stored in SurrealDB was caused by how ranges and record IDs are stored in the database. 
    -  [Record IDs now support storing UUIDs instead of strings](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/4491). 
    -  [`Value::Range` stored as just a range instead of a string](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/4506).

- Some breaking changes were made to the SurrealQL language.
    -  Behaviour of the `UPDATE` statement which no longer allows to update a record that does not exist. In favor of the [`UPSERT`](/docs/surrealql/statements/upsert) statement.
    - Deprecated `file://` in favour of `rocksdb://` or the new `surrealkv://`. 
    - Renamed functions [(meta::*)](/docs/surrealql/functions/database/meta) to (record::*)
    - Functions `string::endsWith()` and `string::startsWith()` renamed to `string::ends_with()` and `string::starts_with()`

### Do I have this issue?

If you are experiencing this issue, an error similar to the following will be thrown when connecting to the database or when selecting specific data.

```bash
error: Storage version is out-of-date.
```

## Moving from 1.x to 2.0.0

A new [`surreal fix`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/fix) command has been implemented to automatically change the format of your stored data. The command is followed by a path to the data. For example:

```bash
# For SurrealKV
surreal fix surrealkv://mydata

# For RocksDB
surreal fix rocksdb:somedatabase
```

### Limitations of the surreal fix command

Although the `surreal fix` command is a quick way to migrate your data, it is not without its drawbacks: 

-  If you have used the now deprecated [`DEFINE TOKEN`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/token) command to define a token on a Scope with the also deprecated [`DEFINE SCOPE`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/scope) command, you will have to update your access management rules to use the new [`DEFINE ACCESS`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/access) which supports creating permissions using [TYPE JWT](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/access/jwt) and [TYPE RECORD](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/access/record) rules.

- If you were querying SurrealDB via the HTTP API, the `surreal fix` command will not update the header format for you. You will need to manually update the header format  from `ns` and `db` to `surreal-ns` and `surreal-db` respectively before using the `surreal fix` command. Learn more about this in the [HTTP documentation](/docs/surrealdb/integration/http).


## Moving from 2.0.0-alpha to 2.0.0

The `surreal fix` command above has been created specifically for 1.x instances. However, data currently on a `2.0.0-alpha` instance can still be manually exported and then reimported into a project running on `2.0.0` via the following steps.

1. Export your current data as SQL. You can do this using the [`surreal export`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/export) command in the terminal:

```bash
# Example export command to export data to a file called `export.surql` in the downloads directory.
surreal export --conn http://localhost:8000 --user root --pass root --ns test --db test downloads/export.surql
``` 

2. This will create a file called `export.surql` in the current directory.

3. You can now import this file back into your project running on `2.0.0`.


```bash
surreal import --conn http://localhost:8000 --user root --pass root --ns test --db test downloads/export.surql
```


## Check for changes in the release notes
