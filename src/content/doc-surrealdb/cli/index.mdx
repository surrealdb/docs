# CLI tool

The SurrealDB command-line tool can be used to export a dataset as SurrealQL from a local or remote SurrealDB database, import SurrealQL data into a local or remote database, and start a single SurrealDB instance or distributed cluster.

## Getting Started

The CLI comes built in with SurrealDB, allowing you to use the `surreal` command from your terminal or command prompt. The CLI documentation provides detailed information on each command, including usage examples and options.

The most commonly used commands are [`surreal start`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/start) to start the server, along with [`surreal sql`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/sql) to open up an interactive shell to make queries. Other common commands are [`surreal upgrade`]() to move to a new version of SurrealDB, and [`surreal import`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/import) and [`surreal export`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/export) to import and export your data.

If you have just installed SurrealDB and want to give it a try using the CLI, the following two commands will be enough to get you started.

This first command will start a database in memory that serves at 127.0.0.1:8000 that has a single root user named 'root' and a password 'root'.

```bash
surreal start --user root --pass root
```

Inside a new window, you can then log in to this running database using the following command. You will be logged in as the root user inside a namespace called `ns` and a database called `db`, with pretty (easily readable) output per query.

```bash
surreal sql --namespace ns --database db --user root --pass root --pretty
```

Once logged in, you can then try out a few queries and see the output.

```bash
ns/db>CREATE person SET age = 20;
ns/db>CREATE person SET age = 30;
ns/db>SELECT * FROM person WHERE age > 25;
```

```bash title="Output"
[
	{
		age: 20,
		id: person:6jodx8xv39jsxdgykt0t
	}
]

[
	{
		age: 30,
		id: person:10bcq2owseyqqoinjgxl
	}
]

[
	{
		age: 30,
		id: person:10bcq2owseyqqoinjgxl
	}
]
```

We hope that the SurrealDB CLI simplifies your interactions with SurrealDB and empowers you to efficiently manage your databases and clusters. Let's dive into the CLI section and explore its capabilities!
