# CLI tool

The SurrealDB command-line tool can be used to export a dataset as SurrealQL from a local or remote SurrealDB database, import SurrealQL data into a local or remote database, and start a single SurrealDB instance or distributed cluster.

## Getting Started

The CLI comes built in with SurrealDB, allowing you to use the `surreal` command from your terminal or command prompt. The CLI documentation provides detailed information on each command, including usage examples and options.

The most commonly used commands are [`surreal start`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/start) to start the server, along with [`surreal sql`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/sql) to open up an interactive shell to make queries. Other common commands are [`surreal upgrade`]() to move to a new version of SurrealDB, and [`surreal import`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/import) and [`surreal export`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/export) to import and export your data.

We hope that the SurrealDB CLI simplifies your interactions with SurrealDB and empowers you to efficiently manage your databases and clusters. Let's dive into the CLI section and explore its capabilities!
