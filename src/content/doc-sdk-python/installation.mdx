# Installation
To get started with the SurrealDB Python SDK, you'll need to install the SDK. In this section, we'll go through the steps to install and initialize the SDK in your project.

## Install the SDK

You can install the Python SDK using your preferred package manager.

<Tabs groupId="node-package-manager">
  <TabItem value="pip" label="pip">
    ```bash
    pip install surrealdb
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="poetry" label="poetry" default>
    ```bash
    poetry add surrealdb
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<br />


{/* ## Initialization
To start using the database, create an instance of SurrealDB, connect to your SurrealDB server, and specify the
namespace and database you wish to work with. Always remember to close the db connection after use.


```python
from surrealdb import SurrealDB

# Connect to the database
db = SurrealDB(url="ws://localhost:8000")
db.connect()
db.use("namespace", "database_name")
# Your DML code...
db.close()
``` */}


## Importing the SDK

After installing the SDK, you can import it into your project.

```python
from surrealdb import SurrealDB
```

## Next Steps

After you have setup the SDK, you can start interacting with your SurrealDB Instance by connecting via any of the available connection engines with either the `context manager` or `AsyncSurrealDB` classes. Learn more about the available connection engines in the [Connection Engines](/docs/sdk/python/connection-engines) section.
