# Connection Engines
There are 3 available connection engines you can use to connect to SurrealDb backend. It can be via Websocket, HTTP or
through embedded database connections. The connection types are simply determined by the url scheme provided in
the connection url.

### Via Websocket
Websocket url can be `ws` or `wss` for secure connection. For example `ws://localhost:8000` and `wss://localhost:8000`.
All functionalities are available via websockets.

### Via HTTP
HTTP url can be `http` or `https` for secure connection. For example `http://localhost:8000` and `https://localhost:8000`.
There are some functions that are not available on RPC when using HTTP but are on Websocket. This includes all
live query/notification methods.


### Using SurrealKV and Memory
SurrealKV and In-Memory also do not support live notifications at this time. This would be updated in a later
release.

    from surrealdb import SurrealDB

    db = SurrealDB("mem://")
    db = SurrealDB("memory://")
    ```

### Effect of connection engine on token & session duration

The connection engine you choose affects how authentication tokens and sessions work:

With websockets connections (`ws://`, `wss://`) you open a single long-lived stateful connection where after the initial authentication, the session duration applies and if not specified, defaults to `NONE` meaning that the session never expires unless otherwise specified. 

When you connect with a HTTP connection (`http://`, `https://`), every request you make is short-lived and stateless, requiring you to authenticate every request individually for which the token is used, creating a short lived session. Hence, the token duration which defaults to 1 hour applies.

You can extend the session duration of a token or a session by setting the `DURATION` clause when creating a new access method with the [`DEFINE ACCESS METHOD`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/access) statement or when defining a new user with the [`DEFINE USER`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/user) statement. 

Learn more about token and session duration in our [security best practices](/docs/surrealdb/reference-guide/security-best-practices#expiration) documentation.
