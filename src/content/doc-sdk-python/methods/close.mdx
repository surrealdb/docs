# `.close()` {#close}

Closes the persistent connection to the database.

```python title="Method Syntax"
db.close()
```

### Example usage
```python
db.close();
```

The `db` instance is also context-aware (implements a context manager), that way you don not need to manually close the instance
### Example usage
```python
with SurrealDB(url) as db:
    # your code goes here
```
