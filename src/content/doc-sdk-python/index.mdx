# Python SDK

The SurrealDB SDK for Python is the primary SDK for interacting with SurrealDB from server-side applications, systems, and APIs, and data analysis and engineering tools. You can use the Python SDK to interact with your SurrealDB database instances, or to run SurrealDB as an embedded database within your Python application, with functionality for executing queries, managing data, running database functions, authenticating to the database, building user signup and authentication functionality, and subscribing to data changes with live queries. When connecting to remote database instances, connections automatically reconnect when terminated.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The SDK requires Python version `3.8` or greater, and is available as a [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/surrealdb/).

> [!CAUTION]
>  This SDK is not yet compatible with `v2.x` of SurrealDB. If you want to use the SDK you must be using `v1.x` of SurrealDB.

To contribute to the SDK code, submit an Issue or Pull Request in the [surrealdb.py](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb.py) repository. To contribute to this documentation, submit an Issue or Pull Request in the [SurrealDB documentation](https://github.com/surrealdb/docs.surrealdb.com) repository.
