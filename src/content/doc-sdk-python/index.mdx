# Overview

The SurrealDB SDK for Python enables simple and advanced querying of a remote database from a browser or from server-side code. By default connections to SurrealDB are made over WebSockets, and automatically reconnect when the connection is terminated. We however also support connecting through a http client, however that is not as fully implemented yet.

To contribute to this documentation, submit an Issue or Pull Request in the [SurrealDB documentation](https://github.com/surrealdb/docs.surrealdb.com) repository.

To contribute to the SDK code, submit an Issue or Pull Request in the [surrealdb.py](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb.py) repository..

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This SDK is not yet compatible with `v2.x` of SurrealDB. If you want to use the SDK you must be on a version`>=1.0.0` but `<2.0`
