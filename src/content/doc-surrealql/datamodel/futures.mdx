# Futures

Futures are values which are only computed when the data is selected and returned to the client. Futures can be stored inside records, to enable dynamic values which are always calculated when queried.

### Simple futures

Any value or expression can be used inside a future. This value will be dynamically computed on every access to the record.

```surql
CREATE person SET accessed_date = <future> { time::now() };
```

## Futures depending on other fields

Futures can be used to calculate values which dynamically change based on other fields. This value will be dynamically computed, on every access to the record, and will use the other field when it is accessed.

```surql
DEFINE FUNCTION fn::get_age($birthdate: datetime) -> int {
    duration::years(time::now() - $birthdate)
};

CREATE person SET
    birthday = <datetime> "2007-06-22",
// highlight-next-line
    can_drive = <future> { fn::get_age(birthday) >= 18 }
;
```
Futures can also dynamically access remote records, perform subqueries, or make use of graph traversal.

```surql
CREATE person SET
	name = 'Jason',
	friends = [person:tobie, person:jaime],
// highlight-next-line
	adult_friends = <future> { friends[WHERE age > 18].name }
;
```

## Futures inside schema definitions

A future can be added to a schema definition as well.

```surql
DEFINE FIELD accessed_at ON TABLE user VALUE <future> { time::now() };

CREATE user:one;
SELECT * FROM ONLY user:one;
-- Sleep for one second
SLEEP 1s;
-- `accessed_at` is a different value now
SELECT * FROM ONLY user:one;
```

This differs from a non-future `VALUE` clause which is only calculated when it is modified (created or updated), but is not recalculated during a `SELECT` query which does not modify a record.

```surql
DEFINE FIELD updated ON TABLE user VALUE time::now();

CREATE user:one;
SELECT * FROM ONLY user:one;
-- Sleep for one second
SLEEP 1s;
-- `updated` is still the same
SELECT * FROM ONLY user:one;
```

## Next steps

You've now seen how to create dynamically computed properties on records, using either simple values, and values which depend on local and remote record fields. Take a look at the next chapter to understand how types can be cast and converted to other types.
