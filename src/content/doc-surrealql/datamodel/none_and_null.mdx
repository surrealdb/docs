# None and null

SurrealDB uses two types called None and Null to represent two different ways in which data may not exist.

## None values
Values can be specifically set to `NONE` in SurrealDB to remove a field from a record.

```surql
CREATE person SET children = NONE;
```
The `NONE` keyword can be written in anycase.

```surql 
CREATE person SET children = NONE, siblings = none;
```

## Null values
Values can be specifically set to `NULL` in SurrealDB to denote a field which is set, but which does not have a value.

```surql
CREATE person SET children = NULL;
```
The `NULL` keyword can be written in anycase.

```surql
CREATE person SET children = NULL, siblings = null;
```
