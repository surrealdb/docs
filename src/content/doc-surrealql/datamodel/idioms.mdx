# Idioms

Idioms in SurrealQL provide a powerful and flexible way to access and manipulate data within records using paths. They allow you to navigate through nested data structures, access fields, array elements, call methods, and perform complex queries with ease. Idioms are similar to expressions in other query languages that provide a path to data within documents or records.

An idiom is composed of a sequence of **parts** that define the path to a value within a record or data structure. Each part specifies how to navigate to the next piece of data. Idioms can be used in various parts of SurrealQL. The most common usecase is in data retrival queries such as `SELECT` statements, but they can also be used in the `WHERE` clause, `SET` clause, and more.

## Parts of an Idiom

An idiom is made up of one or more **parts**, each of which can be one of several types:

- [**Field**](#field-access): Access a field by name.
- [**Index**](#index-access): Access an element of an array by its index.
- [**All**](#all-elements): Access all elements or fields.
- [**Last**](#last-element): Access the last element of an array.
- [**Where**](#where-filter): Filter elements based on a condition.
- [**Method**](#method-chaining): Call a method on the current data.
- [**Graph**](#graph-navigation): Navigate through graph relationships.
- [**Destructure**](#destructuring): Destructure nested objects.
- [**Optional**](#optional-parts): Indicate that the following part is optional.

In this section, we'll explore each part in detail with examples to help you understand how to use idioms in SurrealQL.

### Field Access

Since SurrealDB is, at its core, a document database, each record is stored on an underlying key-value store storage engine, with the ability to store arbitrary arrays, objects, and many other types of data. To access a field in an object, use a dot `.` followed by the field name. 

This is mostly helpful when accessing fields within a record, but can also be used to access fields within an array.

For example, using the `CREATE` statement to add a record into the `person` table:


```surql title="Query"
CREATE person CONTENT {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 30,
    address: {
      city: "New York",
      country: "USA"
    }
};
```
```surql title="Response"
[
	{
		address: {
			city: 'New York',
			country: 'USA'
		},
		age: 30,
		id: person:g87bnds1gcgrnoj4p5q3,
		name: 'John Doe'
	}
]
```

To access the `city` field within the `address` object, you can use the following idiom:

```surql title="Query"
SELECT address.city FROM person;
```

```surql title="Response"
[
  {
    "address": {
      "city": "New York"
    }
  }
]
```
In this example, `person.name` is an idiom that accesses the `name` field of the `person` record.

### Index Access

To access an element in an array by its index, use square brackets `[]` with the index inside. For example, let's say we have a `school` record with some student results. 

```surql title="Query"
CREATE student SET results = [
	{ score: 76, date: "2017-06-18T08:00:00Z", name: "Algorithmics" },
	{ score: 83, date: "2018-03-21T08:00:00Z", name: "Concurrent Programming" },
	{ score: 69, date: "2018-09-17T08:00:00Z", name: "Advanced Computer Science 101" },
	{ score: 73, date: "2019-04-20T08:00:00Z", name: "Distributed Databases" },
];
```

```surql title="Response"
[
	{
		id: student:urxaykt4qkbr8rs2o68j,
		results: [
			{
				date: '2017-06-18T08:00:00Z',
				name: 'Algorithmics',
				score: 76
			},
			{
				date: '2018-03-21T08:00:00Z',
				name: 'Concurrent Programming',
				score: 83
			},
			{
				date: '2018-09-17T08:00:00Z',
				name: 'Advanced Computer Science 101',
				score: 69
			},
			{
				date: '2019-04-20T08:00:00Z',
				name: 'Distributed Databases',
				score: 73
			}
		]
	}
]
```

To access the first student in the `results` array, you can use the following idiom:


```surql
SELECT results[0].score FROM student;
```

```surql title="Response"
[
  {
    "results": [
      { "score": 76 }
    ]
  }
]
```

Here, `results[0].score` accesses the score of the first student in the `results` array. 

### All Elements

To access all elements in an array or all fields in an object, use `[*]` or `.*`. This is useful when you want to access all the elements in an array or all the fields in an object. 

```surql
SELECT results[*].score FROM student;
```

```surql title="Response"
[
	{
		results: {
			score: [
				76,
				83,
				69,
				73
			]
		}
	}
]
```

This idiom selects all elements in the `score` array.

### Last Element

Addionally to access the last element of an array, use `[$]`. Refereing to the `student` record above, we can access the last element of the `results` array using the following idiom:

```surql
SELECT results[$].score FROM student;
```
```surql title="Response"
[
	{
		results: {
			score: 73
		}
	}
]
```

This idiom accesses the last element of the `score` array.

### Method chaining

<Since v="v2.0.0" />

To call a method on the current data, use a dot `.` followed by the method name and parentheses `()` with arguments. SurrealDB supports method chaining, so you can call multiple methods (functions) on the same data. Learn more about [method chaining](/docs/surrealql/functions/database#method-syntax) in the functions section.

For example, let's create a new `person` record 

```surql title="Create a new person record"
CREATE person CONTENT {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 30,
    address: {
      city: "New York",
      country: "USA"
    }
};
```

```surql title="Response"
[
  {
    "person": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "age": 30,
      "address": {
        "city": "New York",
        "country": "USA"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

To call the `uppercase()` method on the `name` field, you can use the following idiom:

```surql
SELECT name.uppercase() FROM person;
```

```surql title="Response"
[
  {
    "name": "JOHN DOE"
  }
]
```

In the example above, `uppercase()` is a method called on `person.name` to convert it to uppercase. Although this method is called as `.uppercase()` it is actually the [`string::uppercase()`](/docs/surrealql/functions/database/string#stringuppercase) function that is called. 

SurrealDB will automatically recognize that the idiom part `.uppercase()` refers to the `string::uppercase()` function and call this function when the query is executed. What this means is that the following two queries are equivilent:

```surql title="Using method chaining"
SELECT name.uppercase() FROM person;
```

```surql title="Using function"
SELECT string::uppercase(name) FROM person;
```

To learn more about string method chaining in SurrealQL, see the [string functions](/docs/surrealql/functions/database/string#method-chaining) section.

### Graph Navigation

SurrealDB can also be used in the context of graph databases, where data is stored and navigated using graph traversal idioms. The [`RELATE` statement](/docs/surrealql/statements/relate) is used to create relationships between records. This allows you to traverse related records efficiently without needing to pull data from multiple tables and merging that data together using SQL JOINs.


For example, let's consider the following data:

```surql title="Create a new planet, city, and explorer records"
CREATE planet:unknown_planet;
CREATE city:el_dorado          SET name = "El Dorado";
CREATE explorer:drake          SET name = "Drake";
CREATE explorer:local_guide    SET name = "Local Guide";

RELATE explorer:drake->discovered->planet:unknown_planet;
RELATE explorer:drake->visited->city:el_dorado;
RELATE explorer:local_guide->assisted->explorer:drake;

```

```surql title="Retrieve all relationships from Drake"
SELECT 
    *,
    ->? AS actions,
    <-? AS was,
    <->? AS involved_in
FROM explorer:drake;
```

```surql title="Response"
[
	{
		actions: [
			discovered:sh9zbsz5u705cxv6qgoi,
			visited:hmtttiqqfa4mt9is1a7j
		],
		involved_in: [
			assisted:1pv8k3p1wpuf0guf5bvm,
			discovered:sh9zbsz5u705cxv6qgoi,
			visited:hmtttiqqfa4mt9is1a7j
		],
		id: explorer:drake,
		was: [
			assisted:1pv8k3p1wpuf0guf5bvm
		],
		name: 'Drake'
	}
]
```

Explanation:

- `*`: Selects all fields of `explorer:drake`.
- `->? AS actions`: Retrieves all outgoing relationships from Drake and aliases them as actions.
- `<-? AS interactions`: Retrieves all incoming relationships to Drake and aliases them as interactions.
- `<->? AS connections`: Retrieves all relationships connected to Drake, regardless of direction, and aliases them as connections.


### Destructuring

<Since v="v2.0.0" />

When working with nested data, you can destructure objects using the `.` and `{ ... }` idioms.

For example, 

```surql title="Create a new person record"
CREATE person:1 SET name = 'John', age = 21, obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: { d: 3, e: 4, f: 5 } };
```

```surql title="Response"
[
	{
		age: 21,
		id: person:1,
		name: 'John',
		obj: {
			a: 1,
			b: 2,
			c: {
				d: 3,
				e: 4,
				f: 5
			}
		}
	}
]
```

```surql
SELECT obj.{ a, c.{ e, f } } FROM person;
```

```surql title="Response"
[
	{
		obj: {
			a: 1,
			c: {
				e: 4,
				f: 5
			}
		}
	}
]
```
You can also OMIT fields that you don't want to destructure using the `OMIT` clause.

```surql 
SELECT * OMIT obj.c.{ d, f } FROM person;
```


```surql title="Response"
[
	{
		a: 1,
		c: {
			e: 4
		}
	}
]
```

Extending the example in the [Graph Navigation](#graph-navigation) section, we can use the `->` idiom to navigate through the graph and destructure the `city` field. 

```surql
SELECT ->visited->city.{name, id}
FROM explorer:drake;
```

```surql title="Response"
[
	{
		"->visited": {
			"->city": [
				{
					id: city:el_dorado,
					name: 'El Dorado'
				}
			]
		}
	}
]
```

#### Using aliases when destructuring

The keyword `AS` is necessary inside `SELECT` statements when [using an alias](/docs/surrealql/statements/select#basic-usage) (a new name for a field).

```surql
LET $town = {
    location: (50.0, -5.4),
    population: 500
};

SELECT 
	location,
	population AS num_people
FROM ONLY $town;
```

```surql title="Output"
{
	location: (50, -5.4),
	num_people: 500
}
```

However, as destructuring involves the creation of a new object, no `AS` keyword is needed. Instead, only the names of the fields are needed. Aliasing is done by choosing a new name, a `:` and the path to the value.

```surql
LET $town = {
    location: (50.0, -5.4),
    population: 500
};

RETURN $town.{
    location,
    num_people: population
};
```

Conceptually, this is somewhat close to a `RETURN` statement.

```surql
LET $town = {
    location: (50.0, -5.4),
    population: 500
};

RETURN {
    location: $town.location,
    num_people: $town.population,
};
```

However, note that destructuring only involves manipulating the object in question, and no parameters or extra fields can be added.

```surql
LET $town = {
    location: (50.0, -5.4),
    population: 500
};
LET $mayor = person:billy;

RETURN {
    location: $town.location,
    num_people: $town.population,
    mayor: $mayor,
	best_dog: dog:mr_bark
};

-- Final lines won't work as neither
-- are fields of the $town object
$town.{
    location,
    num_people: population,
    -- mayor: $mayor,
	-- best_dog: dog:mr_bark
};
```

### Optional Parts

<Since v="v2.0.0" />

The `?` operator is used to indicate that a part is optional (it may not exist) it also allows you to safely access nested data without having to check if the nested data exists and exit an idiom path early when the result is NONE.



```surql
SELECT person.spouse?.name FROM person;
```

This idiom safely accesses `person.spouse.name` if `spouse` exists; otherwise, it returns `NONE`.

### Using Optional Parts



If some `person` records have a `spouse` field and others do not:

```surql
SELECT name, spouse?.name AS spouse_name FROM person;
```

This idiom will return `null` for `spouse_name` if the `spouse` field is not present.

## Combining Idiom Parts

Idioms can combine multiple parts to navigate complex data structures seamlessly.

### Complex Example

Suppose we have the following data:

```surql title="Create a new person record"
CREATE person:5 CONTENT {
    name: "Eve",
    friends: [
        {
            id: "person:6",
            name: "Frank",
            age: 25
        },
        {
            id: "person:7",
            name: "Grace",
            age: 19
        },
        {
            id: "person:8",
            name: "Heidi",
            age: 17
        }
    ]
};
```

```surql title="Response"
{
  "id": "person:5",
  "name": "Eve",
  "friends": [
    {
      "id": "person:6",
      "name": "Frank",
      "age": 25
    },
    {
      "id": "person:7",
      "name": "Grace",
      "age": 19
    },
    {
      "id": "person:8",
      "name": "Heidi",
      "age": 17
    }
  ]
}
```

To get the names of friends who are over 18:

```surql
SELECT friends[WHERE age > 18].name FROM person WHERE id = r'person:5';
```

```surql title="Response"
[
	{
		friends: {
			name: [
				'Frank',
				'Grace'
			]
		}
	}
]
```

## Notes on Idioms

- **Chaining**: Idioms can be chained to traverse deeply nested structures.
- **Performance**: Be mindful of performance when using complex idioms; indexing fields can help.
- **NONE Safety**: Use optional parts (`?`) to handle `NONE` or missing data gracefully.
- **Methods**: Leverage built-in methods for data manipulation within idioms.
- **Type Casting**: Use type casting if necessary to ensure data is in the correct format.

## Best Practices

- **Use Destructuring**: When selecting multiple fields, destructuring improves readability.
- **Limit Optional Parts**: Use optional parts judiciously to avoid masking data issues.
- **Validate Data**: Ensure data conforms to expected structures, especially when dealing with optional fields.
- **Index Fields**: Index fields that are frequently accessed or used in `WHERE` clauses for better performance.

## Summary

Idioms in SurrealQL are a powerful tool for navigating and manipulating data within your database. By understanding and effectively using idiom parts, you can write expressive and efficient queries that handle complex data structures with ease. Whether you're accessing nested fields, filtering arrays, or traversing graph relationships, idioms provide the flexibility you need to interact with your data seamlessly.
