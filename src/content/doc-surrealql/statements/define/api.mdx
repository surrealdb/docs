# DEFINE API statement

## Statement syntax

It introduces custom API endpoints, which can be defined by the user. In addition, it allows database administrators to allow or deny arbitrary quering by either guest, record or system users, or a combination of those with the new --allow-arbitrary-query and --deny-arbitrary-query capability. That affects:


```syntax title="SurrealQL Syntax"
DEFINE API [ OVERWRITE | IF NOT EXISTS ] @endpoint
    [ MIDDLEWARE @function, .. ]
    [ FOR @http_method, .. THEN { @expression } ]
```
