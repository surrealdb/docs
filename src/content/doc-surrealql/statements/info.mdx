# `INFO` statement

The `INFO` command outputs information about the setup of the SurrealDB system. There are a number of different `INFO` commands for retrieving the configuration at the different levels of the database.

```syntax title="SurrealQL Syntax"
INFO FOR [
	ROOT
	| NS | NAMESPACE
	| DB | DATABASE
	| TABLE @table
	| USER @user [ON @level]
    | INDEX @index ON @level
];
```

The information returned from an `INFO` command is an object containing items that almost always correspond to a matching [DEFINE](/docs/surrealql/statements/define) statement. For example, the `INFO FOR NS` command returns the information on the access methods, databases and users of a namespace, which are defined with `DEFINE ACCESS`, `DEFINE DATABASE` and `DEFINE USER` statements.

## Example usage

There are a number of different `INFO` commands for retrieving the configuration at the different levels of the database.

## System  information

### Root information
The top-level ROOT command returns information regarding the users and namespaces which exists within the SurrealDB system.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be authenticated as a top-level root user to execute this command.

#### Examples

```surql
INFO FOR ROOT;
```

```surql title="Sample output"
{
    "namespaces": {
        "ns": "DEFINE NAMESPACE ns"
    },
    "users": {
        "example": "DEFINE USER example ON ROOT PASSHASH '$argon2id$v=19$m=19456,t=2,p=1$S8ggGUFSZY9B6+ZUJADNAw$jcFYLOrx1tq+/YlVk63QNZcP+VbsGD8lpFPvM59aZF4' ROLES OWNER"
    }
}
```

### Namespace information

The `NS` or `NAMESPACE` command returns information regarding the users, databases and access methods under the namespace in use.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be authenticated as a top-level root user, or a namespace user to execute this command.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have a NAMESPACE selected before running this command.

#### Examples

```surql
INFO FOR NS;
```

```surql title="Sample output"
{
    "accesses": {},
    "databases": {
        "db": "DEFINE DATABASE db"
    },
    "users": {
        "ns_user": "DEFINE USER ns_user ON NAMESPACE PASSHASH '$argon2id$v=19$m=19456,t=2,p=1$da30XYKIjHauYbW6CyqgXQ$4rnHoGa3itfY6LarGE/KwoZE+N+AXrydklDXUFUZXGQ' ROLES OWNER"
    }
}
```

### Database information

The `DB` or `DATABASE` command returns information regarding the users, tables, params, models, functions, analyzers and access methods under the database in use.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be authenticated as a top-level root user, a namespace user, or a database user to execute this command.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have a NAMESPACE and a DATABASE selected before running this command.

#### Examples

```surql
INFO FOR DB;
```

```surql title="Sample output"
{
    "accesses": {},
    "analyzers": {},
    "functions": {},
    "models": {},
    "params": {},
    "tables": {
        "person": "DEFINE TABLE person TYPE ANY SCHEMALESS PERMISSIONS NONE"
    },
    "users": {
        "db_user": "DEFINE USER db_user ON DATABASE PASSHASH '$argon2id$v=19$m=19456,t=2,p=1$FhgETjyVbEZmcLiCHf5fCA$zXOb8b0lIzIRrtaLPpWXHlWylC4VFBsfr4SWPF3WBKE' ROLES OWNER"
    }
}
```
    "accesses": {},

### Table information

The `TABLE` command returns information regarding the events, fields, tables, and live statement configurations on a specific table.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be authenticated as a top-level root user, a namespace user, or a database user to execute this command.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have a NAMESPACE and a DATABASE selected before running this command.

#### Examples

```surql
INFO FOR TABLE user;
```

```surql title="Sample output"
{
    "events": {},
    "fields": {
        "name": "DEFINE FIELD name ON user TYPE string PERMISSIONS FULL"
    },
    "indexes": {},
    "lives": {},
    "tables": {}
}
```

### User information

The `USER` command returns information for a user [defined](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/user) on either the root, namespace, or database level.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be authenticated as a user equal to or greater than the level of the user you are attempting to obtain information for to execute this command.

#### Examples

```surql
INFO FOR USER root ON ROOT;
INFO FOR USER ns_user ON NAMESPACE;
INFO FOR USER db_user ON DATABASE;
```

If a level after `ON` is not specified, the `INFO` command will default to the database level. Thus, the following two commands are equivalent.

```surql
INFO FOR USER db_user ON DATABASE;
INFO FOR USER db_user;
```

```surql title="Sample output"
"DEFINE USER db_user ON DATABASE PASSHASH '$argon2id$v=19$m=19456,t=2,p=1$LvgY4ZdWBt5YR+TXd6SNJg$INeqLI5l9vhDtkDGOR2otZMsJHQcT60HtBGgT6F5I9s' ROLES OWNER"
```

### Index information

`INFO FOR INDEX` returns the status for an index: started, initial indexing, update indexing, built, or error.

This command only applies when the [`CONCURRENTLY`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/indexes#using-concurrently-clause) clause is used in a `DEFINE INDEX` command. Without this clause, the following statement will not be executed until the index is fully created, or fails. In this case, the `INFO FOR INDEX` statement will return an empty object: `{}`.


```surql
CREATE |user:50000| SET name = id.id() RETURN NONE;
DEFINE INDEX unique_name ON TABLE user FIELDS name UNIQUE;
INFO FOR INDEX unique_name ON TABLE user;
```

However, when the `CONCURRENTLY` clause is used, the index will build in the background while other statements are permitted to run. In this case, the `INFO FOR INDEX` statement will provide the current status on the index. The following code sample shows such an example in which an index is defined on a large number of records. A [`SLEEP`](/docs/surrealql/statements/sleep) statement is run in between each `INFO FOR INDEX` command to show the progress after each 50 millisecond interval.

```surql
CREATE |user:50000| SET name = id.id() RETURN NONE;
DEFINE INDEX unique_name ON TABLE user FIELDS name UNIQUE CONCURRENTLY;
INFO FOR INDEX unique_name ON TABLE user;
SLEEP 50ms;
INFO FOR INDEX unique_name ON TABLE user;
SLEEP 50ms;
INFO FOR INDEX unique_name ON TABLE user;
SLEEP 50ms;
INFO FOR INDEX unique_name ON TABLE user;
```

```surql title="Possible output"
-------- Query 1 --------
{
	building: {
		count: 0,
		status: 'initial'
	}
}

-------- Query 2 --------
{
	building: {
		count: 17250,
		status: 'initial'
	}
}

-------- Query 3 --------
{
	building: {
		count: 33542,
		status: 'initial'
	}
}

-------- Query 4 --------
{
	building: {
		status: 'built'
	}
}
```

### The `STRUCTURE` clause

> [!NOTE]
> This clause was originally created for internal use and is subject to change without notice.

Adding the `STRUCTURE` clause changes the structure of the statement from an object that contains objects into an object with fields that each contain an array and often extra info.

```surql
DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMAFULL;
DEFINE FIELD name ON user TYPE STRING;

INFO FOR TABLE user;
INFO FOR TABLE user STRUCTURE;
```

```surql title="Output"

-------- Query --------

{
	events: {},
	fields: {
		name: 'DEFINE FIELD name ON user TYPE string PERMISSIONS FULL'
	},
	indexes: {},
	lives: {},
	tables: {}
}

-------- Query --------

{
	events: [],
	fields: [
		{
			flex: false,
			kind: 'string',
			name: 'name',
			permissions: {
				create: true,
				delete: true,
				select: true,
				update: true
			},
			readonly: false,
			what: 'user'
		}
	],
	indexes: [],
	lives: [],
	tables: []
}
```
