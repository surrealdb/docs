# Local database serving

The Surrealist desktop app allows you to easily and effortlessly launch a localhost instance of SurrealDB directly from the interface. For this you will first need to install SurrealDB for your platform. After this you can press the play button in the top right of the interface to start SurrealDB.

### Configuration

Before starting your database, Surrealist needs to know where to find the SurrealDB executable. You can either make it available in your environment PATH, or enter the full path to the executable in the Surrealist settings dialog.

You can configure local database serving from the “Local database” tab, including authentication details, port, storage mode, and executable path.

### Console panel

After launching the local database, you can press the console button to reveal the output of the SurrealDB instance.
