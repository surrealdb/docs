# Troubleshooting

If you experience issues or unintended behaviour when using Surrealist, please [open an issue](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealist/issues/new/choose) on our GitHub repository.
Additionally check the [FAQ](/docs/surrealist/faqs/info) and [known issues](/docs/surrealist/faqs/known-issues) first as they too might solve your issue.
If you are still running into issues you can attempt one of the following:

### Opening the developer console

The developer console may include hints to the cause of your problem. Include any errors you find inside with reported GitHub issues as it may significantly help the maintainers understand your problem.

You can open the developer tools using the following key combination

- **Windows / Linux:** `Ctrl + Shift + i`
- **MacOS:** `Command + Option + i`

### Resetting the config

Removing your configuration file may solve issues, however you will lose configured connections and other settings. It is recommended to backup the config file before deleting it.

The config file can be found at the following location

- **Linux:** `$HOME/.config/SurrealDB/Surrealist/config.json`
- **MacOS:** `$HOME/Library/Application Support/SurrealDB/Surrealist/config.json`
- **Windows:**  `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}\SurrealDB\Surrealist\config.json`
