# Create a New Connection

In Surrealist, there are two ways to create a new connection: using a remote database or via a [sandbox](#create-a-new-connection-using-a-sandbox). Depending on your database setup, you can choose the most suitable option for your needs. We recommend using a sandbox for testing queries and exploring your database.

## Create a new connection to a remote database

If you connect to a remote database, you must provide your database and authentication credentials to establish a connection. To get started, follow these steps:

1. In the introduction screen, select the `create connection` option. 
2. Enter the required details based on your authentication mode.

  Multiple connection options, such as `WS/WSS `, `HTTP/HTTPS`,`Memory`, and `IndexDB`, are available, which you can configure based on your database setup.

3. Click on the `create` button to establish the connection. This will take you to the query view where you can start executing queries.

  }}/>


### Start a Database serving 

After creating a connection, before you can start executing queries, you need to edit this in the database serving if your credentials are not the default `root`.

To edit a database serving, first go to `settings` and select the `Database serving` button. Enter the same details as your connection, then close the window and click on the start serving button at the top right. This will start a database serving on your local machine.

## Create a new connection using a sandbox

Sandboxes are a great way to test your queries and explore your database without connecting to a remote database. To create a new connection using a sandbox,in the introduction screen, click on the `create sandbox` button. This will take you to the query view, where the database is automatically created, and you can start executing queries.

### Load a demo dataset

You can load any supported [demo datasets](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/demo) in the sandbox to test your queries. This allows you to explore the database schema and execute queries on the dataset.

To do this, click the load demo dataset` button and select the dataset you want to load.

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('img/loading-demo-data.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('img/loading-demo-data.png'),
  }}/> */}

Try running some queries on the dataset to understand how Surrealist works.
