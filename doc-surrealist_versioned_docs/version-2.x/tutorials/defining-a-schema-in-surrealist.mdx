# Defining A Schema In Surrealist

Surrealist allows you to design your schemas both visually in the [designer view](/docs/surrealist/concepts/designing-the-database-schema) and with [queries in the query view](/docs/surrealist/concepts/sending-queries), making it easy to create and manage your tables and relationships. 

In this guide, you will walk through defining a schema in Surrealist.

## What is a schema?

A schema is a blueprint of your database that defines the structure of your tables, the relationships between them, and the constraints that apply to your data. 

## Creating a new schema in the designer view

In Surrealist, you can create a new schema in the designer view by defining your tables and their columns, setting permissions, indexing, and establishing relationships between your tables.

To create a new schema in Surrealist, follow these steps:

1. Open the designer view by clicking the designer icon in the sidebar.

2. Click the `+` button to create a new table or a new relation between tables.

3. Enter the table name and click the `create` button.

After your table is created, you can add columns by double-tapping the table name. You can then define permissions, changefeeds, fields, and constraints for the table. You can also toggle the table type depending on your requirements.

:::note
___NOTE:___ By default, the table is schemaless, but you can enforce a schema by toggling the schema button.

## Creating a new schema with the query view

You can also create a new schema in Surrealist using the query view by sending a [`DEFINE TABLE`](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/define/table) query.

For example, to define a new `SCHEMAFULL` table called `users` with columns `firstname`, `lastname`, and `email`, you can send the following query:

```surql
-- Create schemafull user table.
DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMAFULL;

-- Define some fields.
DEFINE FIELD firstName ON TABLE user TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD lastName ON TABLE user TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD email ON TABLE user TYPE string
  ASSERT string::is::email($value);
DEFINE INDEX userEmailIndex ON TABLE user COLUMNS email UNIQUE;
```

After defining the table, you can add data to the table, query the data, and perform other operations on the table.
