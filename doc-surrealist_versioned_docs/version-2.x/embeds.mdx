# Embeds

Embeds are a powerful feature in Surrealist that allow you to embed your queries and results in any website or application. Embeds are a great way to share your queries and results with others, or to embed them in your own documentation or website using Surrealist.

## Creating an Embed

To create an embed, head over to [Surrealist mini generator](https://surrealist.app/mini/new) and enter your query in the query editor.

Once you have entered your query, click on the `Reload Embed` button to generate the embed code. You can then copy this URL and paste it in your website or application as an iframe to embed the query.

If your query uses variables, you can also enter the values for the variables in the `Variables` section and click on the `Reload Embed` button to generate the embed code.

    dark: useBaseUrl('img/light/embed.png'),
  }}
/>


## Loading dataset in Embeds

You can also load datasets like the [surreal deal dataset](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/demo#surreal-deal---deals-so-good-its-surreal) in the embeds by clicking on the `Load Dataset` button on the top and selecting the dataset you want to load. 

This allows you to query the tables within a dataset and embed the results in your website or application.

## Embedding the Query

Once you have entered your query, click on the `Reload Embed` button to generate the embed code. You can then copy this URL and paste it in your website or application as an iframe to embed the query.
