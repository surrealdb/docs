# Installation


## Desktop app

You can download the latest version of Surrealist from our [GitHub releases](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealist/releases) page. We support installers for Windows (`msi`), MacOS (`dmg`), and Linux (`AppImage`). If your platform is unsupported you can still make use of the web app version of Surrealist, although it has a few caveats compared to the desktop app.

## Web app

The hosted web version of Surrealist is available at [surrealist.app](http://surrealist.app) and includes most of the functionality offered by the desktop app, except the ability to spin up a local SurrealDB instance directly from the interface.

:::note
___NOTE:___ Due to security restrictions it will not always be possible to connect to databases hosted locally on localhost (or 127.0.0.1) using the web app in certain browsers. If you intend on doing so, we recommend using the desktop app instead as it does not have such restrictions.
