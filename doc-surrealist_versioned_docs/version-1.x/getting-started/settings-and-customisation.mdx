#  Settings and customisation

In the bottom left of the interface you can find a ⚙ button to open the settings dialog. These settings allow you to further customise the behaviour and appearance of Surrealist, such as switching between light and dark mode, increasing or decreasing the editor font sizes, and configure default values for new connections.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues or unintended behaviour when using Surrealist, please [open an issue](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealist/issues/new/choose) on our GitHub repository. You can use the following methods when running into issues

### Resetting the config

Removing your configuration file may solve issues, however you will lose configured connections and other settings. It is recommended to backup the config file before deleting it.

The config file can be found at the following location

- **Linux:** `$HOME/.config/SurrealDB/Surrealist/config.json`
- **MacOS:** `$HOME/Library/Application Support/SurrealDB/Surrealist/config.json`
- **Windows:**  `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}\SurrealDB\Surrealist\config.json`

___NOTE:___ Avoid sharing your config or uploading it to public locations as it contains the authentication details to your configured connections.
