# Getting Started

When starting up Surrealist you can choose between creating your first connection or opening the sandbox environment. If you are looking to experiment with SurrealQL or get started without setting up a database, choose the sandbox, otherwise select create connection to enter your connection details.

## Connections

In the connection option Surrealist allows you to define and manage multiple connections, each having it’s own combination of endpoint, namespace, database, and authentication. Connections store their own query tabs, favourite tables, and more. You can create as many connections as you prefer, however only one can be active at once. This connection will be displayed in the top left of the interface.

Before creating a connection, ensure that you have a database running that you can connect to. If you are unsure how to do this, you can follow the [running SurrealDB](/docs/surrealdb/installation/running/memory)  guide to start an in-memory database.

### Views

The interface of Surrealist is divided into separate views, each focused on a specific workflow for working with the database. You can switch between views using the navigation bar on the left of the screen. If you are just getting started we recommend using the Query view where you can start writing your SurrealQL queries and visualise their responses. Each available view will be explained in further detail later on in this page.

## Connecting to SurrealDB

You can connect to a local or remote SurrealDB instance by creating a new connection. The connection dialog requires an endpoint, database details, and authentication details.

Enter your database address into the first field in the dialog. The address can be localhost, an ip address, or a domain name. If the database is running on a specific port make sure to append it after the address as well.

The dropdown to the left of the address is the protocol used to connect to your database. If you are unsure what to choose, select `HTTP`.

In the database section you must enter the namespace and database to use for your connection. 

The authentication section first asks you for the authentication method. Changing this can also change the details you will have to enter. For scope authentication, you can also manage the scope data sent along with your request by pressing “Edit scope data”.

    dark: useBaseUrl('img/new-http-connection.png'),
  }}
/>

After filling in all fields, press “Create connection” to continue. You will now be able to see all available views. If the connection was established successfully, you should see a green indicator next to the session name in the top left of the interface.

If the connection failed and you see a red indicator, make sure all your details are correct and update your connection accordingly. You can edit connection details again by expanding the connection list, and choosing “Edit” on your connection.


## Connecting to the sandbox

You can always switch to the sandbox by opening the connections list and choosing “Sandbox”. This option is always available and useful in situations where you would like to test and experiment without storing data persistently.

If you would like to clear the sandbox manually, you can press the “Reset sandbox environment” to clear any records and schema you have configured.
