# Initialization

After [installing the SDK](/docs/sdk/php/setup) and selecting your import choice.
You can initialize a new instance of SurrealDB and connect it to a database endpoint.


```php title="Initialization"
use Surrealdb\Surreal;

$db = new Surreal\Surreal();

try {
    $db->connect("http://127.0.0.1:8000/rpc");
    $db->use([
        "namespace" => "test",
        "database" => "test"
    ]);
} catch (Exception $error) {
    throw new Exception("Failed to connect to SurrealDB", $error);
}

// close the database
$db->disconnect();
```

From the code snippet above, you can see that the PHP SDK has a couple of methods that you can use to initialize a new project with SurrealDB.
