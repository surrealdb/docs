# Authentication

Since SurrealDB is a database that is designed to be used in a distributed environment, it is important to secure the database and the data that is stored in it.
SurrealDB provides a number of methods for authenticating users and securing the database.

## Signin with credentials

To signin with credentials, you can use the `signin` method of the `SurrealDB` class. 
This method takes an associative array with the `username` and `password` keys as arguments.

```php title="Signin with credentials"
use Surrealdb\Surreal;

// First, we initialize a new instance of SurrealDB.
$db = new Surreal\Surreal();

try {
	// Second, we connect to the database.
	$db->connect("http://localhost:8000/rpc");

	
	$db->signin([
		"username" => "admin",
		"password" => "password"
	]);

	// Set the namespace and database for the current connection
	$db->use([
		"namespace" => "test",
		"database" => "test"
	]);

} catch (Exception $error) {
	throw new Exception("Failed to connect to SurrealDB", $error);
}
