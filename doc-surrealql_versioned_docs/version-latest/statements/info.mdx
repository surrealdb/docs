# `INFO` statement

The `INFO` command outputs information about the setup of the SurrealDB system. There are a number of different `INFO` commands for retrieving the configuration at the different levels of the database.

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
INFO FOR [
	ROOT
	| NS | NAMESPACE
	| DB | DATABASE
	| TABLE @table
	| USER @user [ON @level]
];
```

The information returned from an `INFO` command is an object containing items that almost always correspond to a matching [DEFINE](/docs/surrealql/statements/define) statement. For example, the `INFO FOR NS` command returns the information on the access methods, databases and users of a namespace, which are defined with `DEFINE ACCESS`, `DEFINE DATABASE` and `DEFINE USER` statements.

## Example usage

There are a number of different `INFO` commands for retrieving the configuration at the different levels of the database.

## System  information

### Root information 
The top-level ROOT command returns information regarding the users and namespaces which exists within the SurrealDB system.

:::note
<em> NOTE: </em> You must be authenticated as a top-level root user to execute this command.
::: 

#### Examples

```surql
INFO FOR ROOT;
```

```bash title="Sample output"
{
    "namespaces": {
        "ns": "DEFINE NAMESPACE ns"
    },
    "users": {
        "example": "DEFINE USER example ON ROOT PASSHASH '$argon2id$v=19$m=19456,t=2,p=1$S8ggGUFSZY9B6+ZUJADNAw$jcFYLOrx1tq+/YlVk63QNZcP+VbsGD8lpFPvM59aZF4' ROLES OWNER"
    }
}
```

### Namespace information

The `NS` or `NAMESPACE` command returns information regarding the users, databases and access methods under the namespace in use.

:::note
<em> NOTE: </em> You must be authenticated as a top-level root user, or a namespace user to execute this command.
::: 

:::note
<em> NOTE: </em> You must have a NAMESPACE selected before running this command.
::: 

#### Examples

```surql
INFO FOR NS;
```

```bash title="Sample output"
{
    "accesses": {},
    "databases": {
        "db": "DEFINE DATABASE db"
    },
    "users": {
        "ns_user": "DEFINE USER ns_user ON NAMESPACE PASSHASH '$argon2id$v=19$m=19456,t=2,p=1$da30XYKIjHauYbW6CyqgXQ$4rnHoGa3itfY6LarGE/KwoZE+N+AXrydklDXUFUZXGQ' ROLES OWNER"
    }
}
```

### Database information

The `DB` or `DATABASE` command returns information regarding the users, tables, params, models, functions, analyzers and access methods under the database in use.

:::note
<em> NOTE: </em> You must be authenticated as a top-level root user, a namespace user, or a database user to execute this command.
::: 

:::note
<em> NOTE: </em> You must have a NAMESPACE and a DATABASE selected before running this command.
::: 

#### Examples

```surql
INFO FOR DB;
```

```bash title="Sample output"
{
    "accesses": {},
    "analyzers": {},
    "functions": {},
    "models": {},
    "params": {},
    "tables": {
        "person": "DEFINE TABLE person TYPE ANY SCHEMALESS PERMISSIONS NONE"
    },
    "users": {
        "db_user": "DEFINE USER db_user ON DATABASE PASSHASH '$argon2id$v=19$m=19456,t=2,p=1$FhgETjyVbEZmcLiCHf5fCA$zXOb8b0lIzIRrtaLPpWXHlWylC4VFBsfr4SWPF3WBKE' ROLES OWNER"
    }
}
```
    "accesses": {},

### Table information

The `TABLE` command returns information regarding the events, fields, tables, and live statement configurations on a specific table.

:::note
<em> NOTE: </em> You must be authenticated as a top-level root user, a namespace user, or a database user to execute this command.
::: 

:::note
<em> NOTE: </em> You must have a NAMESPACE and a DATABASE selected before running this command.
::: 

#### Examples

```surql
INFO FOR TABLE user;
```

```bash title="Sample output"
{
    "events": {},
    "fields": {
        "name": "DEFINE FIELD name ON user TYPE string PERMISSIONS FULL"
    },
    "indexes": {},
    "lives": {},
    "tables": {}
}
```

### User information

The `USER` command returns information for a user [defined](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/user) on either the root, namespace, or database level.

:::note
<em> NOTE: </em> You must be authenticated as a user equal to or greater than the level of the user you are attempting to obtain information for to execute this command.
::: 

#### Examples

```surql
INFO FOR USER root ON ROOT;
INFO FOR USER ns_user ON NAMESPACE;
INFO FOR USER db_user ON DATABASE;
```

If a level after `ON` is not specified, the `INFO` command will default to the database level. Thus, the following two commands are equivalent.

```surql
INFO FOR USER db_user ON DATABASE;
INFO FOR USER db_user;
```

```bash title="Sample output"
"DEFINE USER db_user ON DATABASE PASSHASH '$argon2id$v=19$m=19456,t=2,p=1$LvgY4ZdWBt5YR+TXd6SNJg$INeqLI5l9vhDtkDGOR2otZMsJHQcT60HtBGgT6F5I9s' ROLES OWNER"
```
